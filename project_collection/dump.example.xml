'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.

April always starts on the same day of week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.

April starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and also starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year.

April of a [[common year]] starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year (Additionally, April of a common year that follows another common year starts on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year) and ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year.  April of a leap year and a year that follows a leap year ends on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, while April of a [[leap year]] starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year.

In years that precede a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[September]], both of the following year; in years that precede a [[leap year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[June]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[June]], both of the following year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

August doesn't start on the same day of the week as another month in [[Common year|common years]], but starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[Leap year|leap years]].  August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].

No other month in a [[common year]] starts on the same day of the week as August, but August starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year.

During common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the preceding year (Additionally, August of a common year that follows another common year starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] of the preceding year) and ends on the same day of the week and [[March]] and [[June]] of the preceding year; during leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] and ends on the same day of the week as [[September]], both of the preceding year.

In years that precede common years, August starts and ends on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year; in years that precede leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[October]], and ends on the same day of the week as [[February]] and [[October]], both of the following year.

'''Art''' is a creative activity by people. The artist hopes that it affects the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. Some people find art relaxing.  

Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. 

Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
*Plastic arts
**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]
**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
*Performing arts
**Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
*Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What &quot;art&quot; means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of [[emotion]]. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feel that there is no way to express it other than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.Also,art is a way to express something which have a deep meaning inside.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]].

==Where it came from==
The earliest letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] of the [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 0.9% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013). Earth’s Oxygen: a mystery easy to take for granted. New York Times. [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

[[Wind]] is moving air.  Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as   [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[wikt:ash|ash]]. This [[pollution]] is one of the reasons for [[global warming]], by causing the &quot;[[greenhouse effect]]&quot;.

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things.

{{shortcut|[[WP:ADMIN]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:SYSOP]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:A]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:MOP]]}}
[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|[[WP:CRAT]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:BUR]]}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

== List of administrators ==
:''An automated list of accounts with administrator rights is available at [[Special:ListAdmins]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous community but six, which also have other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north and near the border with Euskadi)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.
