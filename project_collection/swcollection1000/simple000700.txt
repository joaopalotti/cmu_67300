 Eurasia  is the combined landmass of the continents of Europe and Asia in the  north ern part of the  Earth . Eurasia is made of  Europe  and  Asia , which are on the same  tectonic plate  and do not have a  sea  between them.  The word is made by adding "Eur" (from  Eur ope) to "Asia" to make "Eurasia".

Some  geography geographers  say it's all just one continent, because unlike  the Americas  or  Africa , Europe and Asia are not divided by  sea .  The  Ancient Greeks   division divided  the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa.   Since then, people have been talking about Asia and Europe as two continents so it is now a  tradition .      

Some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land (called an  isthmus ) like  North America  and  South America .  However, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea at all.

Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. West Eurasia is Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia because the  Sahara Desert  divides North Africa from the other parts of Africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea.
