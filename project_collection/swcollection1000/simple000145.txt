Einstein on the Beach

Einstein on the Beach  is an  opera  written by the  minimalist   composer   Philip Glass  and theater director and designer  Robert Wilson . It was first acted for an audience in  Avignon ,  France  in 1976. 

It is a single act opera, about five hours long with no  intermission . Because of the length and the minimalist ( repetition repetitive ) nature of the music, audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish. Glass's music tends to cycle round, but does not exactly repeat itself. Admittedly, he has described himself as a composer of "music with repetitive structures". ref name bio citation  url http://www.philipglass.com/bio.php   periodical PhilipGlass.com  title Biography  accessdate November 10, 2008  postscript   ref  Though his earlier music fits what is normally called "minimalist", he has since evolved stylistically. ref citation  url http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/485/   title Is Glass half empty?  periodical New York Magazine  first Ethan  last Smith  accessdate November 10, 2008  postscript   ref ref name appomattox citation  url http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/arts/music/23smit.html   periodical The New York Times   title If Grant had been singing at Appomattox  date September 23, 2007  first Steve  last Smith  postscript   ref
