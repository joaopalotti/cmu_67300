Mixture

In  chemistry , a  mixture  is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances. These substances be  chemical element s or  Chemical compound compounds . A mixture can be made of  liquid s,  solid s, or  gas es.

A mixture is not the same as a  Chemical compound compound  which is made of two or more  atom s connected together.  For instance, a mixture of the gases  hydrogen  and  nitrogen  contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound  ammonia  which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.

A mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called  heterogenous , one where this is not the case is called  homogeneous . A third form is called  colloid . 

If one substance in a mixture  dissolution dissolves  in the other, it is called a  solution . For example if  sugar  is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a  suspension (chemistry) suspension .

Solids can be mixtures also.  Many kinds of  soil  and  mineral rock  are mixtures of different  mineral s.
