Most Microsoft  computer program programs  cannot be  download downloaded  for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the  Microsoft Windows Windows   operating system ) are often already installed when people buy a new  computer .

  Software  
 Microsoft Windows  is an  operating system , which means that it is the basic software that makes people's computers work and lets other programs work.  The majority of desktop and  laptop  computers run Windows, and so do some  tablet computer s and a few  smartphone s. The latest version of Windows is  Windows 10 . 

 Microsoft Office  is an  office suite .  It lets people write documents on their computer with  Microsoft Word , make charts and graphs with  Microsoft Excel  and make presentations with  Microsoft PowerPoint .

 Internet Explorer  is a piece of software that lets people look at things online (known as  web browser browsing ) and download things from the  Internet . 

Microsoft also makes other programs for the Internet.  Many of them are called  Windows Live  services, with the name Windows Live put in front of the old name of the service, like Windows Live  Hotmail , which is an email service. However, the Windows Live name is not being used much anymore. Microsoft runs a service called  Bing  on the internet which lets people  Search engine search for things  like  photography photos  or information online.

 MS-DOS  is the first existing operating system developed by Microsoft, used for primitive computers and terminals.

 Microsoft Sharepoint  is a server tool included in Microsoft Office (2007, 2013).
Microsoft Expression series is a web development tool which is now discontinued.
 Minecraft  and many other programs have been bought by Microsoft and developed further.

  Services and hardware  
 Skype  is also a service by Microsoft. It was not started by Microsoft, but was later purchased by Microsoft. Skype is a free program that lets people call other people, either through the  telephone , or through Skype on the other person's computer.

The  Xbox , the  Xbox 360  and the new  Xbox One  are  video game consoles , which means they let people play video games when connected to their  television s. Microsoft is one of the three big companies that make video game consoles. The other two are  Nintendo  and  Sony .  Xbox Live  is a service that lets people play online against other people anywhere in the world. Microsoft also makes many  personal computer PC  games.

Microsoft also has many other small products such as  tablet computer s and computer peripherals including  Computer mouse mice  and  computer keyboard keyboards  that are used with computers. The Microsoft Surface is an example, which is a laptop/tablet convertible.
