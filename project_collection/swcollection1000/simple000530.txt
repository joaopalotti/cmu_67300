  Criticism  
Many users complain that Windows creates problems for them. Some people say that their computers become slower/less fast because of Windows. Many people also complain about problems that make their computer less safe to use, even though Microsoft tries to fix these problems. Because Windows was until recently the most popular operating system (today mobile operating systems such as Android are more popular), most  computer virus es are created to infect computers running Windows.  fact date February 2015
