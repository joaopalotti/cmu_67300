The  Macintosh Operating System  ( Mac OS ) is a program that allows a  Apple Macintosh Macintosh   computer  to  operate and be used. Mac OS was first made by Apple Inc. in 1984. In those days Mac OS was called  Macintosh System Software  - which was shortened to  System  or  SSW  ( S ystem  S oft w are). The term "Mac OS" first appeared in the  splash screen  for System 7.5.1, but was not adopted as the new name until the release of  Mac OS 7.6 .

The latest version of Mac OS is  Mac OS X  10.11. The X in the OS X name is a roman numeral for 10.
