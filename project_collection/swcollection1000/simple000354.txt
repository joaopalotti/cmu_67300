 New York City  is the largest  city  in the  United States  and  New York . Over 8 million people live in it, and over 22 million people live in and around it. It is in the south end of the state of  New York , which is in the  northeastern United States . It is the financial capital of the US since it is home to the nation's  stock market ,  Wall Street , and the  One World Trade Center .  It is also the home of the Headquarters of the  United Nations .  It is sometimes considered to be the cultural center of the world.

  History  
The oldest  Borough part  of the city, the island of  Manhattan , still has its original  Lenape   Native American  name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by  Europe ans in the 1500s.   Florence Florentine  explorer  Giovanni da Verrazzano  found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer  Henry Hudson  named the  Hudson River  in 1609.

New York City was settled by Europeans from  The Netherlands  in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York  "Nieuw Nederland"  ( New Netherland ) and they named a  fort  and town on the south end of Manhattan Island  Nieuw Amsterdam  (New  Amsterdam ), ref name nieuw cite book   last Rubin   first Susan Goldman   year 2004   title L'Chaim!: To Jewish Life in America!   publisher Harry N. Adams in association with The Jewish Museum   isbn 0810950359  ref  after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second  Anglo-Dutch War . They changed the name to  New York , to honor the  Duke of York , who later became King  James II  of  England .  The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. They were afraid of the English  Royal Navy , so they traded the town to England for the colony of  Surinam  in  South America , which they thought was worth more money.

By the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen ( Brooklyn ), Vlissingen ( Flushing ), and Nieuw Haarlem ( Harlem ). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens.  Dutch people Dutch , English and other people had been living together in New York for a long time.

New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city.  The  important  Battle of Long Island  of the  American Revolution  was fought in Brooklyn in 1776. New York was the capital of the United States under the  Articles of Confederation  from 1785 to 1788.  When the  US Constitution  was made, it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790. ref http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm The Nine Capitals of the United States . United States Senate Historical Office. Accessed June 9, 2005. Based on Fortenbaugh, Robert,  The Nine Capitals of the United States , York, PA: Maple Press, 1948. ref 

In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the western towns in Queens County to make Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today.  Around this time, many new  immigrant s came into New York City.  They came in at  Ellis Island , an island in New York's harbor near the  Statue of Liberty .  Many of them then moved to the  Lower East Side  neighborhood in Manhattan, which had over a million people living in just a few square miles.

Early in the twentieth century, with better transportation, more people moved to the new parts of the greater city, and many commuted to Manhattan. Many  skyscraper s and other big buildings were put up to provide places to work.

  Geography  
 File:USA grants tomb.jpg thumb|150px|right| Grant's Tomb , Manhattan 

Most of New York City is on three islands near the  Atlantic Ocean , although one part is on the mainland of  North America . The city includes all of  Manhattan Manhattan Island  and  Staten Island , and the western end of  Long Island . There are also many smaller islands.

The city is divided into five major parts called  boroughs . Each one is also a county. They are:

 class wikitable sortable  Boroughs   Notes
   Manhattan    (New York County, on Manhattan Island)
   Brooklyn    (Kings County, on Long Island)
   The Bronx    (Bronx County, on the mainland)
   Queens    (Queens County, on Long Island)
   Staten Island    (Richmond County, on Staten Island)
 

Water divides several parts of the city. Part of the  Hudson River  forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side, and the State of  New Jersey  on the other side. The  East River  forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of  Long Island Sound  separates the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as  Rockaway  in Queens and  City Island  in the Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and belongs to the  United Nations Headquarters .

The hallmark of New York city is its many  skyscraper s, especially in Manhattan. In New York City there are about 5600 skyscrapers. 48 of them are over 200 metres tall, which is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world.
