The laser reaches 90 km into the Earth's  mesosphere  to form a reference point. It helps sharper observations of phenomena such as the giant  black hole  at the centre of the  galaxy .

The stellar disc of the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge, a radius beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the Galaxy. Beyond a radius of about 40,000 light years, the number of stars drops much faster, for reasons that are not understood. ref cite web url http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3857   title [0909.3857  The structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by IPHAS early A stars  publisher Arxiv.org  date 2009 accessdate 2010-08-10 ref

  Myth  
In  Greek mythology ,  Zeus  places his son (the baby  Heracles ) whose mother was a  wikt:mortal mortal   woman  on  Hera 's  breast  while she is sleeping so that the baby will drink her divine milk and become  immortality immortal . However, Hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know. According to Greek mythology, she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky, making a  wikt:faint faint  band of light known as the Milky Way. ref Cite web
