The islands are near the east Asian coast, in the western part of the  Pacific Ocean . ref name CIA Factbook 

Japanese  people  call their country "Nihon" or "Nippon", ref name CIA Factbook cite web url https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html title Japan publisher CIA accessdate 2016-06-19 work CIA World Factbook ref  which means "the origin of the Sun" in Japanese.

 History 
 Main History of Japan 
The earliest records on Japan are from  China Chinese  documents. One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others, and brought peace.

The Japanese began to write their own history after the  5th century 5th  and  6th century 6th centuries , when people from  Korea  and China taught Japan about the  Chinese writing system . Japan's neighbours also showed them the ways of  Buddhism . ref name Japan history cite web url http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2131.html   title Early Japan (until 710)  accessdate 2009-06-16  work japan-guide.com  ref  The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways, for example, by building strongly on ideas such as  Zen , which came from mainland Asia. ref name Japan history 

In the ancient and the  Middle Ages , China gave Japan many new cultural ideas, but their friendship became weaker later. In the late  13th century ,  Mongol Empire Mongolians  from China tried to invade Japan twice, but they could not. br 
The  samurai  and  shogun  of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval  Europe .

Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the  16th century . The  Portugal Portuguese  were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the  Spain Spanish ,  England English  and  Holland Dutch  came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought  Christianity . Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in  Nagasaki  city. Many Christians were killed. Only the Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in  1854  by Commodore  Matthew C. Perry Matthew Perry , when the  United States Americans  wanted to use Japanese ports for American  whale  boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him. ref cite web  url   http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/teach/ends/opening.htm   title Perry & Opening of Japan  work history.navy.mil  year 2009 [last update]  accessdate December 1, 2011 ref 

This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The  Meiji Restoration  of  1868  stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The  Empire of Japan  was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and  annexation annexed   Ryukyu Islands Ryukyu  Kingdom,  Taiwan , and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the  First Sino-Japanese War , the  Boxer Rebellion  the  Russo-Japanese War , and the  Second Sino-Japanese War , which grew to become a part of  World War II  when Japan became allies with  Nazi Germany  and Fascist Italy.

In 1941, Japan attacked  Pearl Harbor  in  Hawaii , a water base of the United States, and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in  World War II . American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland, America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two  atomic bomb s on the cities of  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki , killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the  Soviet Union  began to fight against Japan, and the Japanese army in  Manchuria  lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the  Potsdam Conference Potsdam  Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new  constitution , in which it promised to never go to war again.

 Geography 
 File:Mountfujijapan.jpg thumb| Mount Fuji  with  cherry blossom  trees and a  shinkansen  in the foreground--all three are iconic of Japan 
Japan is a group of islands in the Western  Pacific , off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are  Honshu ,  Hokkaido ,  Shikoku , and  Kyushu , and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the  Sea of Japan  and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in the  Japanese language , is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu. ref name CIA Factbook 

In the middle of Japan there are mountains. ref name CIA Factbook  They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct  volcano es, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3776m or 12,389 feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year. ref name CIA Factbook  The most recent big earthquake was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities.

90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the  land , near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast.

Over 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is  Tokyo , which is the capital.

 see also Japanese tea ceremony Noh Kabuki 

Many things in Japanese culture originated in  China , like  Go  and  bonsai .

Japan's traditional food is  seafood , rice,  miso soup , and vegetables.  Noodles  and  tofu  are also common.  Sushi , a Japanese food made of cooked rice with  vinegar  with other ingredients such as raw fish, is popular around the world.

The religion in Japan is mostly  Shinto  and  Buddhist . Due to the tolerant nature of the two main Japanese religions, and the resulting intermixing mixing of the two, many Japanese identify as both Shinto and Buddhist at the same time. There are small numbers of  Christian s and  Muslim s, and a few  Jew s.

When it comes to  popular culture , Japan is famous for making  video game s. Many of the biggest companies that make games, like  Nintendo ,  Namco , and  Sega , are Japanese.

It cannot agree with some neighbouring countries on whether the land belongs to Japan or the other country. 
   Senkaku Islands  problem (with  China  and  Taiwan )
   Liancourt Rocks  island problem (with  South Korea )
  Southern  Chishima Islands  problem (with  Russia )
