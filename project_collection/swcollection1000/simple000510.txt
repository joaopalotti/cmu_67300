 Volapuk  is a constructed language created in  1880  by  Johann Martin Schleyer . Schleyer was a Catholic priest from  Germany . He felt that  God  had told him in a dream to make an international language. Volapuk conventions took place in  1884 ,  1887 , and  1889 . The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other.

Volapuk became less popular after 1887 when  Esperanto  was published. Part of the reason was that Esperanto is easier to learn with a simpler  grammar . There are only 25-30 Volapuk speakers in the world today.

The vocabulary of Volapuk is mostly  English language English , with some words from  German language German  and  French language French . 

"Vol" and "puk" come from the English words "world" and "speech". The grammar is based on  Indo-European languages .

An example of Volapuk is the translation of the  Lord's prayer :

 poem 
     lang vo O Fat obas, kel binol in suls, paisaludomoz nem ola! 
    Komomod monargan ola! 
    Jenomoz vil olik, as in sul, i su tal! 
    Bodi obsik vadeliki govolos obes adelo! 
    E pardolos obes debis obsik, 
    as id obs aipardobs debeles obas. 
    E no obis nindukolos in tendadi; 
    sod aidalivolos obis de bas. 
    Jenosod!
