 Metabolism  is the name given to the  chemical reaction s which keep us alive. It happens in the cells of living  organisms .

Reactions  catalysis catalyzed  by  enzyme s allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word 'metabolism' can also refer to  digestion  and the transport of substances into and between different cells.

Metabolism is usually divided into two categories.  Catabolism  breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of  cellular respiration .  Anabolism  uses energy to construct  molecules  such as  protein s and  nucleic acid s.

The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like the  Krebs cycle . One chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes.

The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds  nutrition nutritious  and which  poison ous. For example, some  prokaryote s use  hydrogen sulfide  as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. ref name Physiology1 cite journal  author Friedrich C.  title Physiology and genetics of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria  journal Adv Microb Physiol  volume 39  issue   pages 235-89  year 1998  pmid 9328649  doi 10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60018-1  series Advances in Microbial Physiology  isbn 9780120277391 ref  The speed of metabolism, the  metabolic rate , influences how much food an organism will need, and how it is able to get that food.

A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. ref cite journal  author Pace N.R.  title The universal nature of biochemistry  journal Proc.
