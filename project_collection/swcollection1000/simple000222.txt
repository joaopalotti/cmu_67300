Before 1861, Italy was not a  state . The area was made of a group of independent states, ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain). In the 1850s the  Earl  of  Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour Camillo Cavour  was the Head of Government of the "State of Sardinia". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.

In 1860,  Giuseppe Garibaldi  took control of Sicily, creating the  Kingdom of Italy  in 1861. ref name Encarta   Vittorio Emanuele II  was made the King. But, in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the  Pope  and Austrian Empire.

Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria, and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep  Catholicism Catholic  people from being active in politics. That year, Italy finally came back together.

Italy participated in  World War I  as an  ally  of  Great Britain ,  France , and Russia against the  Central Powers . Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern  border , near Austria. After the " Caporetto  defeat", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers  wikt:surrender surrender ed, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.

In 1922, a new Italian government started, and it was ruled by  Benito Mussolini , the leader of  Fascism  in Italy. He became  Head of Government  and  dictator , calling himself "duce" - which means " leader " in  Italian language Italian . He became friends with German dictator Hitler, and Mussolini followed him into  World War II . Italy entered the war in 1940 as an ally of  Germany  and  Japan  against France, Great Britain, and  Russia . During the war, Italy controlled most of the  Mediterranean Sea .

On  July 25 , 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism, and, on  September 8 , 1943,  Badoglio  said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know who to shoot. In Northern Italy, a  wikt:movement movement  called  Italian resistance movement Resistenza  started to fight against the German  invasion invaders .

Mussolini tried to make another Northern Italian  Fascism fascist  state, the  Republic of Salo , but it failed. On  April 25 , 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on  June 2 , 1946, and, for the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia  dynasty  and adopted a republic government.

In February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the  Allies of World War II Allies  losing all the colonies and some territorial areas ( Istria  and parts of  Dalmatia ).

Since then Italy has joined  NATO  and the European Community (as a founding member), becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.
