  Geologic history  
The Atlantic formed when the  Americas  moved west from  Eurasia  and  Africa . This began sometime in the  Cretaceous period , roughly 135 million years ago. It was part of the break-up of the  supercontinent   Pangaea . ref name brit 

The east coast of  South America  is shaped somewhat like the west coast of  Africa , and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time ( continental drift ). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the  mid-Atlantic Ridge , ref cite web  title Seafloor Spreading  website National Geographic  publisher National Geographic Society  url http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/seafloor-spreading/ ref  while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is  Subduction folding under itself . ref cite web  url http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~djs/aleut/info_for_public.html   publisher Columbia University  title Subduction Zones and Earthquakes ref 

 Geography 
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the  Denmark Strait ,  Greenland Sea ,  Norwegian Sea  and  Barents Sea . ref name brit  It connects with the  Mediterranean Sea  though  Strait of Gibraltar . ref name marbef 

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The  20th meridian east 20deg East meridian  defines its border. ref name marbef cite web  title The Atlantic Ocean  page 1  url www.marbef.org/outreach/downloads/Atlantic%20ocean%20pullout.pdf  publisher Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning EU Network of Excellence  archiveurl http://web.archive.org/web/20120901123921/http://www.marbef.org/outreach/downloads/Atlantic%20ocean%20pullout.pdf   archivedate September 1, 2012 ref 

In the southwest, the  Drake Passage  connects it to the Pacific Ocean.  Panama Canal  links the Atlantic and Pacific. ref name brit cite web  authors Barnes, C.A.; Broadus, J.M.; Fleming, R.H.; et al.  title Atlantic Ocean  website Eneyclopaedia Britannica  publisher Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.  date November 21, 2004  url https://www.britannica.com/place/Atlantic-Ocean ref 

The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about  convert 106400000 km2 sqmi . The  volume  of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometre s. ref name marbef 

The  average  depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is  convert 3339 m fathom ft lk out . The greatest depth is  Milwaukee Deep  near  Puerto Rico , where the Ocean is  convert 8380 m fathom ft  deep. ref name marbef 

  Gulf Stream  
The Atlantic Ocean has important  ocean current s.  One of these, called the  Gulf Stream , flows across the North Atlantic. ref name gulfstream cite web  url http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/oceans-continents-and-polar-regions/oceans-and-continents/gulf-stream   title Gulf Stream  website  Encyclopedia.com  publisher Dictionary of American History, The Gale Group, Inc.  date 2003 ref   Water gets heated by the  sun  in the  Caribbean Sea  and then moves northwest toward the  North Pole .  This makes  France ,  Ireland ,  Britain ,  Iceland , and  Norway  in  Europe  much warmer in  winter  than  Newfoundland  and  Nova Scotia  in  Canada . ref name gulfstream  Without the Gulf Stream, the  climate s of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole. ref name gulfstream 

There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on  South Africa .

  Geology  
The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge .  It runs from north to south under the Ocean. ref name mar cite web  url http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/504/   title The Mid-Atlantic Ridge  website United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  publisher  UNESCO World Heritage Center ref  This is at the boundary of four  tectonic plate s: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. ref name mar  The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58deg south. ref name mar 

The  salinity  of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 33-37 parts per thousand and varies with  latitude  and season. ref cite book last1  Talley first1  L.D. date 2002 chapter Salinity Patterns in the Ocean: Volume 1, The Earth System: Physical and Chemical Dimensions of Global Environmental Change url http://www.shorstmeyer.com/msj/geo130/salinitypatterns.pdf editor1-last MacCracken editor1-first M.C. editor2-last Perry editor2-first Dr. J.S. title Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change publisher John Wiley and Sons pages 629-640 isbn 0-471-97796-9 ref
