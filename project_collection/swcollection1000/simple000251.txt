A  king  is a  man  who rules a  country , because of  inheritance . A king usually comes to power when the previous  monarch  dies, who is usually a family member of his. Sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarch's  abdication , for example  George VI . For most of history, most countries were ruled in this way, especially in Europe. Some countries, such as France, are no longer monarchies. Some, such as the  United Kingdom , still have a  royal family . In some countries, people chose a new king from other people to decide from. 

The wife of a king is called a  queen . A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen.

If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a  monarchy . A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom.
