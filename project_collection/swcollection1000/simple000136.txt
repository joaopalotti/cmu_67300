Earth is  Rock (geology) rocky . It is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the sun by mass and by size. It is much smaller than the  gas giant s such as  Jupiter .

  Chemical make-up  
Overall, Earth is made of  iron  (32.1 percent % ),  oxygen  (30.1 percent % ),  silicon  (15.1 percent % ),  magnesium  (13.9 percent % ),  sulfur  (2.9 percent % ),  nickel  (1.8 percent % ),  calcium  (1.5 percent % ), and  aluminium  (1.4 percent % ). The 1.2 percent %  left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals. Chemicals that are very uncommon (such as  gold  and  platinum ) can be very valuable.

The structure of Earth changes from the inside to the outside. The  Planetary core center of earth  ( Earth's core ) is mostly iron (88.8%), nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% other things. ref Morgan J.W. & Anders E. 1980.

Oxygen is normally a gas but it can  oxide join  with other  chemicals  to make  chemical compound compounds  like  water  and rocks. 99.22 percent %  of rocks have  oxygen  in them. The most common  oxygen -having rocks are  silica  (made with  silicon ),  alumina  (made with  aluminum ),  rust  (made with  iron ),  lime (chemical) lime  (made with  calcium ),  magnesia  (made with  magnesium ),  potash  (made with  potassium ), and  sodium  oxide, and there are others as well. ref Chisholm, Hugh (editor). 1911. "Petrology" in the  Encyclopaedia Britannica , 11th edition. Cambridge University Press. ref 

  Shape  
Earth's  shape  is a  spheroid : not quite a  sphere  because it is slightly  oblate squashed  on the top and bottom. The shape is called an  oblate spheroid . As Earth spins around itself, the  centrifugal force  forces the  equator  out a little and pulls the  geographical pole poles  in a little. The equator, around the middle of Earth's surface, is about  convert 40,075 km mi sp us disp or sigfig 4  long. 

The highest mountain above  sea level the well-known  Mount Everest  (which is  convert 8.8 km mi sp us abbr on disp or sigfig 2   elevation above sea level ) is  not  actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth. Instead, the sleeping  volcano   Mount Chimborazo  in  Ecuador  is; it is only  convert 6.3 km mi sp us abbr on disp or sigfig 2   elevation above sea level  but it is almost at the  equator . Because of this, Mount Chimborazo is  convert 6,384.4 km mi sp us abbr on disp or sigfig 5  from the center of the Earth, while  Mount Everest  is  convert 2.1 km mi sp us disp or sigfig 2  closer to it. ref cite web url http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=42&article=589 title Did Edmund Hilary climb the wrong mountain? publisher    Professional Surveyor Magazine   work   May 2000 Volume 20 Number 5 first   Joseph H.  last   Senne  date   May 2000 accessdate   2008-10-24 ref ref name lancet365_9462_831 cite journal   last Sharp   first David   title Chimborazo and the old kilogram   journal The Lancet   date 2005-03-05   volume 365   issue 9462   pages 831-832   doi 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71021-7  ref ref name tall_tales cite web   url http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1086384.htm    title Tall tales about highest peaks   publisher Australian Broadcasting Corporation   accessdate 2008-12-29 ref  Similarly, the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the  Challenger Deep  in the  Mariana Trench  in the  Pacific Ocean .

  What it is like inside

The  Kola superdeep borehole deepest hole ever dug  is only about  convert 12.3 km mi disp or sp us sigfig 2 . We know something about the inside of the Earth, though, because we can learn things from  earthquake s and the times when  volcano es  Volcanic eruption erupt . We are able to see how quickly the  shock wave s move through Earth in different places.

The inside of Earth is very different from the outside. Almost all of Earth's liquid water is in the  ocean sea s or close to the surface. The surface also has a lot of  oxygen , which comes from plants. Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface, but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas. The rocks on the surface of Earth ( Earth's crust ) are well known. They are thicker where there is land, between  convert 30 to 50 km mi disp or sp us abbr on sigfig 2  thick. Under the  ocean sea s they are sometimes only  convert 6 km mi disp or sp us abbr on sigfig 2  thick. ref cite web url http://www.agu.org/reference/gephys/15_tanimoto.pdf title Crustal Surface of the Earth author Toshiro Tanimoto accessdate 2009-08-02 publisher American Geophysical Union ref  There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the Earth's crust.

A very few rocks also fall out of the sky ( meteorite s).

Below the crust is warm and almost- liquid  rock that is always moving around (the  Earth's mantle ). Then, there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock (the  outer core ). This is very hot:  convert 7000 degC degF disp or sigfig 2 . ref cite web url http://chianti.geol.ucl.ac.uk/~dario/pubblicazioni/PTRSA2002.pdf title The ab initio simulation of the Earth's core date 2002-04-25 accessdate 2009-08-02 publisher The Royal Society author D.

  Surface  
The outside of the Earth is not even. There are high places called  mountain s, and high flat places called  plateau s. There are low places called  valley s and  canyon s. For the most part, moving  wind air  and  rain water from the sky  and  tide sea s  erosion damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces . The air and water then move these pieces to lower places. Because of this, the Earth would have been very flat a long time before now. The fundamental cause of the differences in the Earth's surface is  plate tectonics .

All places on Earth are made of, or are on top of, rocks. The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock. Over 70 percent %  of the Earth is covered by  ocean sea s full of  salt y water. ref name Physical-Hydro cite web url http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8a.html title Chapter 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere accessdate 2009-08-06 publisher Physical Geography ref  This salty water makes up about 971/2 percent %  of all Earth's water. The  fresh water  people can drink is mostly  ice . Only a very small amount is in  river s and under the Earth for people to drink and use. ref cite web url http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/   title World water resources and their uses  accessdate 2009-08-06 publisher UNESCO ref  The air above the Earth stops the water from going away into  outer space . Also, much of the land on Earth is covered with plants, or with what is left from earlier living things. Places with very little rain are dry wastes called  desert s. Deserts usually have few living things, but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall. Places with large amounts of rain may be  rain forest large woods . Lately, people have changed the  environment  of the Earth a great deal.

  Air  
 main Atmosphere 
All around the Earth is a large amount of air (the  atmosphere ). The mass of the Earth pulls the  gas ses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of  nitrogen  (about 78 percent % ) and  oxygen  (about 21 percent % ) but there are a few other gasses as well. ref citeweb url http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html title NASA - Earth's atmosphere accessdate 2009-08-06 publisher NASA ref  Most living things need the air (or parts of the air gripped in the water) to breathe and live. They use the gasses especially  oxygen  and  carbon dioxide to make and use  sugar  and to give themselves power.

The air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the  troposphere ). The day to day changes in this level of air are named  weather ; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the  climate .  Rain  and  storm s are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up.  convection Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up . ref name NASA citeweb url http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html title  What causes weather? accessdate 2009-08-06 publisher NASA ref  The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water)  evaporation gets water in it  but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make  cloud s and  rain  as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the  water cycle . ref name NASA 

Above this first level, there are four other levels. The air gets colder as it goes up in the first level; in the second level (the  stratosphere ), the air gets warmer as it goes up. This level has a special kind of  oxygen  called  ozone . The  ozone  in this air keeps living things safe from  ultraviolet radiation damaging rays from the Sun . The power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer. The middle level (the  mesosphere ) gets colder and colder with height; the fourth level (the  thermosphere ) gets warmer and warmer; and the last level (the  exosphere ) is almost outer space and has very little air at all. It reaches about half the way to the Moon. The three outer levels have a lot of  electricity electric power  moving through them; this is called the  ionosphere  and is important for  radio  and other electric waves in the air. It is also where the  Northern Lights  are.

Even though air seems very light, the weight of all of the air above the outside of the Earth ( air pressure ) is important. Generally, from  sea level  to the top of  exosphere the outer level of the air , a space of air one  square centimeter  across has a mass of about 1.03  kilogram kg  and a space of air one  square inch  across has a weight of about 14.7  Pound (mass) pounds . The mass of the air also keeps the Earth safe when rocks ( meteorite s) hit it from outer space. Without the air, the damage meteorites do would be much greater. Because of the air, meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth.

The air also keeps the Earth warm, specially the half turned away from the Sun. Some gasses   especially  methane  and  carbon dioxide     greenhouse effect work like a blanket to keep things warm . ref citeweb url http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7h.html title Fundamentals of physical geography - the greenhouse effect accessdate 2009-08-06 publisher Physical Geography ref   #History In the past , the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since people have grown used to the heat we have now, though, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways people create  electricity electric power  use burning kinds of  carbon especially  coal ,  oil , and  natural gas . Burning these creates new  carbon dioxide  and can cause more warming. A  climate change large discussion  is going on now about what people should do about  global warming the Earth's latest warming , which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been good for people: plants have grown better and the weather has been better than  Little Ice Age when it was colder before . Some people who learn about science, though, say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on.

  People  
 main Human 
About seven  billion  people live on Earth. They live in about 200 different lands called  countries . Some (like  Russia ) are large with many large cities. Others (like  the Vatican ) are small. The five countries with the most people are  China ,  India , the  United States ,  Indonesia , and  Brazil . About 90% of people live in the  northern hemisphere north half  of the world, which has most of the land.  Scientist s think that people originally came from  Africa . Now, 70% of all people do not live in Africa but in  Europe  and  Asia . ref Diamond, Jared. 1997.  Guns, Germs, and Steel : the fate of human societies . New York: Norton. ref 

People change the Earth in many ways. They have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years. When there was enough food, they were able to build towns and cities. Near these places, men and women were able to change rivers,  irrigation bring water to farms , and stop  flood s (rising water) from coming over their land. People found useful animals and  domestication bred  them so they were easier to keep.
