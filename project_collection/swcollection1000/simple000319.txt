Compared to what is known about the other planets in the  Solar System , little is known about Mercury.  Telescope s on the Earth show only a small, bright crescent. The first of two  spacecraft  to visit the planet was  Mariner 10 Mariner 10 , ref http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-085A ref  which mapped only about 45% of the planet's surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the  MESSENGER  spacecraft, which finished mapping the planet in March 2013. 

Mercury looks a lot like Earth's  Moon . It has many  crater s with areas of smooth plains, no moons around it and no  atmosphere  as we know it. However, Mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere. ref name sciencefact  Unlike Earth's moon, Mercury has a large  iron   planetary core core , which gives off a  magnetic field  about 1% as strong as that of the  Earth . ref cite web  url http://www-spc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/merc_mag/ title Mercury magnetic field publisher C. T. Russell & J. G. Luhmann accessdate 2007-03-16 ref  It is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core.

Known sightings of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek  astronomers  thought that Mercury was two different objects: one able to be seen only at sunrise, which they called  Apollo ; the other that was only able to be seen at sunset, which they called  Hermes . ref name Dunne cite book title The Voyage of Mariner 10 -- Mission to Venus and Mercury author Dunne, J. A. and Burgess, E. chapterurl http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/ch1.htm publisher NASA History Office year 1978 chapter Chapter One url http://history.nasa.gov/SP-424/ ref  The English name for the planet is from the  Ancient Rome Romans , who named it after the Roman  Roman mythology god   Mercury (mythology) Mercury , which they thought to be the same as the Greek god  Hermes . The symbol for Mercury is based on Hermes'  Staff (stick) staff . ref cite book title Astronomy: A Textbook first John Charles last Duncan year 1946 publisher Harper & Brothers pages 125 quote The symbol for Mercury represents the Caduceus, a wand with two serpents twined around it, which was carried by the messenger of the gods. ref 

Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the warmest. This is because it has no  greenhouse effect , so any heat that the Sun gives to it quickly escapes into space. ref cite web   url http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/14143062    title CBBC Newsround   publisher British Broadcasting Corporation   accessdate February 04, 2012 ref 

  Inside Mercury  
Mercury is one of four  inner planet s in the  Solar System , and has a rocky body like the  Earth . It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with a  radius  of  cvt 2439.7 km mi ref name nssdcMercury  Mercury is even smaller than some of the largest moons in the solar system, such as  Ganymede  and  Titan (moon) Titan . However, it has a greater mass than the largest moons in the solar system. Mercury is made of about 70%  metal lic and 30%  silicate  material. ref name strom cite book  title Exploring Mercury: The Iron Planet  last Strom  first Strom, Robert G. coauthors Sprague, Ann L.  year 2003  page 52  isbn  1852337311 ref  Mercury's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only a little bit less than Earth's. ref name nssdcMercury
