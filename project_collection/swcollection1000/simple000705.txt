 Oceania  is a name used in  geography  for the  continent  made up by  Australia ,  New Zealand ,  New Guinea , and several other  island   nation s in the surrounding area. Some people call this part of the world  Australasia  instead.

The term "Oceana" does not have one single agreed definition. In politics ( United Nations  etc) it includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from  Papua New Guinea  east, but not the  Malay Archipelago  or  Indonesia n New Guinea.

The widest definition of Oceania includes the entire region between continental Asia and the Americas, including islands in the Pacific Rim such as the  Japan ese  archipelago ,  Taiwan , and the Aleutian islands. On the other hand, the Oceania  ecozone  includes all of  Micronesia ,  Fiji , and all of  Polynesia  except New Zealand.

Sometimes, people use the term 'Oceania' to include only the  Polynesia n and  Melanesia n islands in the  Pacific Ocean , as separate from Australasia.

For these reasons, it is  not  correct to say that Australasia is part of Oceana, because what is meant by 'Oceana' is not clear. Australasia has an exact definition in  biogeography  and geology.  Australasia includes New Zealand, Australia (including  Tasmania ), and Melanesia, New Guinea, and the islands just north and east of Australia. All these are south-east of the  Bali - Lombok  line. This is known as the  Wallace Line , after  Alfred Russel Wallace .
