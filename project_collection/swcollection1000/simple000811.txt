A  telescope  is an important  tool  for  astronomy  that gathers light and directs it to a single point. Some do this with curved  mirror s, some with curved  Lens (optics) lenses , and some with both. Telescopes make faraway things look bigger, brighter and closer.  Galileo Galilei Galileo  was the first person to use a telescope for astronomy, but he did not invent them. The first telescope was invented in the  Netherlands  in 1608. Some telescopes, not mainly used for astronomy, are  binoculars ,   camera lens es , or  spyglasses .

The word "telescope" is usually used for light your eyes can see, but there are telescopes for "invisible" light.  Infrared telescope s look like normal telescopes, but have to be kept cold since all warm things give off  infrared  light.  Radio telescope s are like  radio  antennas, usually shaped like large dishes. 

 X-ray  and  Gamma ray  telescopes have a problem because the rays go through most metals and glasses. To solve this problem, the mirrors are shaped like a bunch of rings inside each other so the rays strike them at a shallow angle and are reflected.   These telescopes are  space observatory space telescopes  because not enough of this radiation reaches the Earth.  Other space telescopes are put in  orbit  so the  Earth's atmosphere  does not interfere.
