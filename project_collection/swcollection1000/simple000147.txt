Ethnic group


An  ethnic group  is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some or multiple ways. They may all have the same  ancestor s, speak the same  language , or have the same  religion . They often live in the same or surrounding area.  

Sometimes almost all of the people in one  country  are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.

The  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ensures the rights of ethnic groups in Article 27 and also gives them the right to use their own language.
