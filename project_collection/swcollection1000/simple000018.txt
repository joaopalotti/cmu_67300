Abbreviation

An  abbreviation  is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The  English language  occasionally uses the  apostrophe  mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use  Period (punctuation) periods , especially the ones that come from the  Latin  language. Common Latin abbreviations include  i.e.  [id est]  that is ,  e.g.  [exempli gratia]  for example , and  et al.  [et alia]  and others .

Some new abbreviations have been created by  scientist s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the  Internet .

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are  acronym s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word " radar " is an  acronym  for "Radio Detection and Ranging". The name of the large computer company  IBM  comes from the words "International Business Machines". The name of the part of the  United States  government that sends  rocket s into  outer space  is NASA, from the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration". When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write "LOL" to mean "Laughing Out Loud". People sometimes write "ASAP" for "As Soon As Possible".
