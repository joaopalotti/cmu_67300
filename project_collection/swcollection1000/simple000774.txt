A  meteor shower  is an event when many  meteors  seem to come from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by  meteoroid s entering  Earth's atmosphere  at extremely high speeds on  parallel  paths. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them burn up and never hit the Earth's surface.

A meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet, such as Earth, and streams of debris from a  comet . ref Whipple F.L. 1951. A comet model II. Physical relations for comets and meteors.  Astrophys. J .  113 , 464 ref  Comets are dirty snowballs, made up of rock embedded in ice,  orbit ing the  Sun . Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its  orbit , some of its ice vaporizes and meteoroids will be shed. The meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream, also known as a "dust trail".

Most of our short-period meteor showers are the product of rare disintegrations, when large chunks break off a mostly dormant  comet . ref name Jenniskens P. 2006 Jenniskens P. 2006.  Meteor showers and their parent comets . Cambridge University Press. ref  Examples are the  Quadrantids  and  Geminids . They originated from a breakup of asteroid-like objects,  2003 EH1  and  3200 Phaethon , respectively, about 500 and 1000 years ago. The fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust, sand, and pebbles, and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream, which later moves into Earth's path.

The most visible meteor shower in most years are the  Perseids , which peak on 12 August each year at over one meteor per minute. NASA has  http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/estimator.html a useful tool to calculate how many meteors per hour are visible from your observing location .

The  Leonids Leonid  meteor shower peaks around 17 November of each year. About every 33 years, the Leonid shower produces a big meteor storm, peaking at thousands of meteors per hour. Leonid storms gave birth to the term "meteor shower" when it was first realised, during the November 1833 storm, that the meteors radiated from near the star Gamma Leonis. The last Leonid storms were in 1999, 2001 (two), and 2002 (two). Before that, there were storms in 1767, 1799, 1833, 1866, 1867, and 1966. When the Leonid shower is not  storming  it is less active than the Perseids.
