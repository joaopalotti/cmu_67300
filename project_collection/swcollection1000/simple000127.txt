 Denmark  ( lang-da Danmark ), officially named the  Kingdom of Denmark , is a  Nordic countries Nordic country  in  Northern Europe . It is the furthest south of the  Scandinavia n countries, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with  Germany . It borders both the  North Sea  to the west and the  Baltic Sea  to the east. Denmark is a  developed country  with a large  welfare state ; ref name Esping-Andersen Esping-Andersen, G. (1990).  The three worlds of welfare capitalism . Princeton University Press. ref  In 2006 and 2007, surveys ref http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4086092&page=1 ref  ranked Denmark as "the happiest place in the world," based on standards of health,  welfare , and  education .

The  capital city  of Denmark is  Copenhagen , on the island of Sealand. Denmark is a  constitutional monarchy  (meaning the  head of state  is a monarch who has few established powers) with a queen,  Margrethe II of Denmark Margrethe II . Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a  parliament  to make decisions for them, and it has a  democracy democratic government  headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is  Lars Lokke Rasmussen .

In geography,  Denmark  is the land in northern Europe, where the  Danish people Danes  live. In the political sense, the  Kingdom of Denmark  also includes the  Faroe Islands  in the  Atlantic Ocean , and  Greenland  in  North America . All three parts of the country have different languages and culture.

  History  
Denmark was first united in the  10th century , during the  Viking  period, by the king Harald Bluetooth ( circa 985 ), who first converted Denmark to  Christianity . The Vikings are well known for invading countries.  In the  11th century , the Danish Vikings controlled  England  (the  Danelaw ) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the  Kalmar Union ) Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called  Denmark-Norway)  stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the  Atlantic Ocean , including the  Faroe Islands ,  Iceland  and  Greenland . Iceland became  independent  from Denmark in 1944.

 File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848. 
Denmark became a  constitutional monarchy  in  June 5 ,  1849  when it adopted a  constitution  which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people.  June 5  is  now a holiday in Denmark, called "Constitution Day".

Over the years Denmark lost many of lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the  Second Schleswig War  (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom  Prussia  (now a part of  Germany ). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of  Neutrality (international relations) neutral ity after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the  First World War . 

On  April 9 ,  1940 , Denmark was invaded by  Nazi Germany  and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout  World War II . During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000  Jews  to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. 

After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of  Bornholm . The German Commandant  von Kamptz  who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns  Ronne  and  Nexo . After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.

After World War Two, Denmark became a member of  NATO  and the  European Union . Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the  Kingdom of Denmark  and have their own governments and limited power.

  Government and politics  
 File:Helle Thorning-Schmidt-2.jpg thumb|150px| Helle Thorning-Schmidt , former Prime Minister of Denmark. 
Denmark has three branches of power; the  judiciary  (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the  legislature  (the  Folketing Danish parliament ). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is  Lars Lokke Rasmussen , who was  election elected  in June 2015.

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a  monarchy monarch  (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen  Margrethe II of Denmark Margrethe II . Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a  constitutional monarchy  in 1849.

Elections to the  Folketing parliament  are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a  coalition   government , and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister.

 File:Da-map.png thumb|left|Map of Denmark 
Denmark is the smallest of the  Scandinavia n countries. The neighbours are  Germany  (to the south),  Sweden  (to the east),  Norway  (to the north) and the  United Kingdom  (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland ( Jylland ), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the  Baltic Sea , to the west the  North Sea , to the north the  Skagerrak  and to the north-east the  Kattegat .

The western part of Denmark is the  peninsula  of  Jutland  ( lang-da Jylland , pronounced  yoo'-land ), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand ( Sjaelland ), and Funen ( Fyn ). To the east is the island of  Bornholm  in the  Baltic Sea , the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen.

The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Mollehoj, which is 170.86 metres (560.56 ft) tall. ref cite journal title Danmarks nye top journal Aktuel Naturvidenskab   first Jorgen   last Dahlgaard   volume 2005 issue 1 page 2 url    http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf   archiveurl    http://web.archive.org/web/20080307040437/http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf   archivedate   7 March 2008 format PDF accessdate 20 January 2012 ref harv ref   There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland.

  Climate  
The  weather  in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the  winter , it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of  snow . Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The  climate  and  topography  are not good for winter sports.

Most  summer s are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.

  Regions and municipalities  
 File:Map DK Regions2.png thumb|left|A map of the regions of Denmark 
Denmark is divided into five regions ( Danish language Danish :  regioner  or  region  for one). The regions replaced the former counties ( amter ) in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.

  Transport  
 File:Storebaeltbroen.JPG thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark  
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many  bridge s. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by  road s and  railroad s. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years.  The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by  boat  or  airplane  to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away.  If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build.  Somebody has to pay for it, nothing is free.

 Cycling  is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat.  Copenhagen  is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000 km. ref cite web  url    http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm    title   Cykelruter og regioner   accessdate   20 January 2012   publisher Visitdenmark.com   language   Danish ref
