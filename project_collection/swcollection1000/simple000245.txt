  The Month  
 File:Sneeuw1.jpg thumb|200px|right| Snow  in January in the  Northern Hemisphere , where it is a  winter  month. 
January is named for  Janus , the  Roman mythology Roman   god  of  door s and  gate s.

January and  February  were put on the  calendar  after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar,  winter  did not have months. Although  March  was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new  Roman Republic consul s (Roman leaders).

January is a  winter  month in the  Northern Hemisphere  and a  summer  month in the  Southern Hemisphere . In each  hemisphere , it is the seasonal equivalent of  July  in the other.  Perihelion , the point in its orbit where the  Earth  is closest to the  Sun , also occurs in this month, between  January 2  and  January 5 . January has 31 days and starts on the same day of the week as  October  in  common year s and the same day as  April  and  July  in  leap year s. It ends on the same day of the week as  February  and  October  in  common year s, and ends on the same day as  July  in  leap year s. January is the only month of the year that always has a "twin" - a month that starts and ends on the same day of the week as it does. In a common year, this is  October . In a leap year, this is  July .

January always starts and ends on the same day of the week as  May  of the preceding year.

January in common years that precede another common year starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the following year, and ends on the same day of the week as July of the following year; during leap years and years that precede a leap year, January starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and ends on the same day of the week as April and December of the following year.

January's flower is the  carnation  with its  birthstone  being the  garnet . The meaning of the garnet is constancy.

The first day of January is called  New Year's Day . It is said that it became this date when Roman consuls took office on this day in  153 BC . Different calendars across  Europe  made this the start of the New Year at different times, as some observed it on  March 25 .

Reaching over from  December , the  Christmas  season in  Christianity  also extends into this month. Eastern  church es celebrate  Christmas  on  January 6  or  January 7 , and  Epiphany (holiday) Epiphany  on  January 18  or  January 19  - In Western Christianity this occurs on  January 6 , with  Christmas  occurring on  December 25 .
