Theology

Theology  is the  Research study  of one or more  religion s 
("Theo-" means  God  in  Greek language Greek  and "-logy" is study, which makes it "God study" or "study of God"). Somebody who studies theology is called a theologian. Books or ideas about theology are called theological.

Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some people study theology to better understand their own religion, while other people study theology so that they can compare religions.

The word 'theology' was first used to describe the study of God in  Christianity  but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so. Some people use the words 'comparative theology' when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once.

During the  High Middle Ages , it was thought that theology was the highest  humanities subject  learned in  University universities . Theology at that time was named "The Queen of the  Science s". There was a plan for young men to study easy subjects and then harder subjects. The easiest subjects were called the  Trivium (liberal arts) Trivium . The next harder subjects were called the  Quadrivium . Finally, young men were expected to study theology. This meant that the other subjects existed primarily to help with theological thought.
