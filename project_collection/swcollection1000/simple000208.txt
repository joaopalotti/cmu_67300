Healing

Healing  is a process that happens in the  body . Through healing,  cell s are able to repair damaged  Tissue (biological) tissue .
There are two different ways healing can happen:
  The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind. This is called  regeneration .
  The damaged tissue is replaced with  scar  tissue. This is called  repair 

Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.
