Subtraction

Subtraction  is the  arithmetic  operation for finding the  wikt:difference difference  between two  number s. The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are, minuend - subtrahend = difference. The expression 7 - 4 = 3 can be spoken as "seven minus four equals three," "seven take away four leaves three," or "four from seven leaves three."

If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a  negative number . For example, 17 - 25 = ( -8 ). We can say this as, "Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight."
