Social capital

Social capital  is the willingness of people to help each other.  

It often replaces  money  which people would use to  buy  the same help.

 Society  works best when there is plenty of social capital. The less social capital there is, the more social  problem s there usually are. If there is no social capital,  war  and  revolution  often  wikt:result results .

People who have no  money  and cannot get help from  society  may have to agree to do things they do not want to do, or force others to do things they do not want to.   Organized crime  grows in this way, and so do  forced labour  and  slavery .

Most ways of  measure measuring  social capital have to do with  :wikt:trust trust  - people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more.  Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help.  A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping.  Some call this kind of person a social  parasite . They are very hard to detect, unlike people who  :wikt:cheat cheat  or commit  fraud . When there are too many of these kinds of people, especially when they are  politician s, people begin to  broken wikt link mistrust mistrust  their  government .  Rather than work with a  political party  to change  law , they may start to look for direct  wikt:revenge revenge  for things. 

Social capital is a lot like real  Capital (economics) capital . The more money a person or a society has, the easier it is to do things and the better off people are. The less money, the more difficult things become and the worse people feel.
