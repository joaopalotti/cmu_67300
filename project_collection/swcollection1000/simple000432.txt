Spache Readability Formula

Spache Readability Formula  is one method of finding out how hard a piece of  write writing  is (its  textual difficulty ).

The method compares  word s in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called  unfamiliar . The  number  of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a  formula . The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text.

Spache works best on texts that are for  child ren under the age of eight.

the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level

According to Oleander Solutions ( http://www.oleandersolutions.com ), the revised Spache Formula is:

    GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) + .659 

Where:

    GL = U.S. grade level
    ASL = Average sentence length
    UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words
