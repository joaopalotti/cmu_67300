Manchester United play at  Old Trafford . It became the club's home ground in 1909, and a stadium was constructed to a capacity of 77,000. In the  Second World War , bombings damaged the stadium. While the stadium was being fixed, they played "home" games at  Manchester City 's  Maine Road . The stadium was converted to have only seats in 1993 due to the  Taylor Report , but the capacity fell to 44,000. In 1995, expansions in the North Stand raised the capacity to 55,000. In the middle of 1999, the East and West Stands were expanded to give the stadium a capacity of 67,000. Then between 2005 and 2006 8,000 more seats were added.
