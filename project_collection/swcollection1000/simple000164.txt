monththisyear 2 
 February  is the second  month  of the  year , coming between  January  and  March , with 28 days in  Common year common years , and 29 days in  leap year s. In  Sweden  in  1732  the month had 30 days. This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world. In  1930  and  1931 , February had 30 days in the  Soviet Union  because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from "februa", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.

February starts on the same day of the week as  March  and  November  in  Common year common years , and  August  in  Leap year leap years . February always ends on the same day of the week as  October , and additionally,  January  in  Common year common years .

  The Month

February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January). This is because in the original  Roman calendar , the two months of  winter , when not much would happen in agriculture, did not have names.

February is the second month of the year, coming between  January  and  March , and is also the shortest month, with 28 days in a  common year , and 29 days in a  leap year . February begins on the same day of the week as  March  and  November  in  common year s, and on the same day as  August  in a  leap year . Every year, February ends on the same day of the week as  October , and in common years, February also ends on the same day of the week as  January . In a  leap year , February is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week.

February always starts on the same day of the week as June of the preceding year, and during common years, it ends on the same day of the week as  May  of the preceding year, and during leap years,  August  and  November  of the preceding year.

February during common years that precede another common year starts on the same day of the week as  August  of the following year, and during leap years and years that precede a leap year,  May  of the following year. February during years that precede a common year ends on the same day of the week as  July  of the following year, and during years that precede a leap year,  April  and  December  of the following year.

February is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, will have four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday, this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999, 6 years back to 1993, 11 years back to 1982, 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965, and will be observed in 2021. In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday, with the next occurrence in 2026, and previous occurrences in 2015 (11 years earlier than 2026), 2009 (6 years earlier than 2015), 1998 (11 years earlier than 2009) and 1987 (11 years earlier than 1998). This works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.

From circa 700 BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise.  Leap year  Day,  February 29 , is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as  2012  and  2016 , but this does not apply when the year ending in "00" at the turn of the  century  does not divide equally into 400. This means that  1600  and  2000  were  leap year leap years  in the  Gregorian calendar , but  1700 ,  1800 , and  1900  were rather common years. This is where the  Julian calendar  calculated dates differently, as it always repeated  February 29  every four years.

February is a  winter  month in the  Northern Hemisphere  and a  summer  month in the  Southern Hemisphere . In each  hemisphere , it is the  season al equivalent of  August  in the other. In  weather   lore ,  Groundhog Day , in the  United States , is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the  winter .

February's flower is the  violet (plant) violet  and its  birthstone  is the  amethyst . The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity. The  zodiac  signs for February are  Aquarius (astrology) Aquarius  ( January 21  to  February 19 ), and  Pisces (astrology) Pisces  ( February 20  to  March 20 ).
