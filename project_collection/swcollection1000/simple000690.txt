  What do sociologists do?  

Sociologists research the structures that organize society, such as race,  gender  (whether a person is male or female), and  social class es (rich or poor). They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse.

Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or "sub-fields". Sociology includes many sub-fields that examine different aspects of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society. The field of demography studies changes in a population size or type. The field of criminology examines criminal behavior and crime. Political sociology studies government and laws. Sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender.

Many sociologists also do research outside of the university. Their research helps teachers, lawmakers, and government administrators to make better institutions, government programs, and rules.

Sociologists often use  statistics  to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave. Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods.

  History of sociology  

Social analysis has been done since the time of  Plato . Sociology became a type of science in the early 1800s. European cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories. Sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted.

The word "sociology" was invented by French thinker  Auguste Comte  in 1838. Early thinkers who wrote about sociology included  Karl Marx  and Max Weber.

Sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the University of Kansas in 1890. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by  Emile Durkheim . The first sociology department to be established in Britain was at the  London School of Economics  and Political Science in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by  Max Weber .
