  Kinds of war  
Sometimes, people don't see a difference between fighting between countries or people, and the  declaration of war formal declaration  of a  state of war.  Those who do see this difference usually only use the word "war" for the fighting where the countries'  government s have officially declared war on each other. Smaller armed conflicts are often called  riot s, rebellions,  coup d'etat coups , etc. 

One country may send forces to another country for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is to help keep order or prevent  genocide killings of innocents  or other  crimes against humanity . It may be to protect a friendly government against an uprising. Here it may be called a  police action  or  humanitarian intervention  instead of a war. Some people think it's still a war.
