Simile

A  simile  is a  figure of speech  that compares two different things, usually by using the words 'like' or 'as'. It is used to make a  direct  wikt:comparison comparison . Similes may be confused with  metaphor s, which do the same kind of thing. Similes use comparisons, with the words ' like ' or 'as'. Metaphors use indirect comparisons, without the words 'like' or 'as'.
