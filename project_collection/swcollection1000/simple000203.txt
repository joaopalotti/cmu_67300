Help:How to change pages

This page tells you  how to edit  (change) or make new pages on Wikipedia. Anyone can make pages. If you are learning how to make pages, or just want to test an idea, it is a good idea to begin in the  Wikipedia:Sandbox Sandbox .

Click on "change this page" at the top of any page, then you can write in the large edit box that will appear. 

The "Change summary" box you will see at the bottom of that page is used to tell others what you are changing or trying to do. For example, if you are writing a new article about dogs, you can put "new article about dogs" in the change summary.

You can also press "Show preview" to see what the page will look like before anyone else does, and check for mistakes. When you are all ready, and you want to send the page, press " Save Page " - and like that your page is on Wikipedia!

To make a new page, find or make a "red link" with the article name on Wikipedia, for example  poodle , if you want to write about poodles.

You can also write the page name in the "search" box in the sidebar to the left on every page, then click " Go ". If there is no page already with that exact name, the search results page will say: " There is no page titled [PAGENAME] . You can  create this page ". From that page, just click on the redlink that says "create this page" to get to the "edit box" and make a new page. 

You can also create a new article from this page by typing its name in the box below:

 width 60% style border:1px solid black 
 inputbox 
type=create
width=45
 inputbox 
 

The page name should be  singular , for example "Poodle" not "Poodles". The first letter will automatically be capitalized (upper case) in the title, whether you give it a capital or not.  If there are two or more words in the title, they should be capitalized only if it is a proper name, for example "Elvis Presley" not "Elvis presley". If the words are not a proper name, do not use capital letters, for example "Big cat" not "Big Cat".

In the first sentence of the new page you make, write the name of the page in  bold  writing.

 Bold text 

 These words are in "bold" (heavy) text:  one, two, three 

To make text bold, use three  apostrophes  (') before and after the word.
(An apostrophe is also called a single quote or an inverted comma.)

For example:  code nowiki '''Bold text''' nowiki code  =  Bold text 

 Italics 

 These words are in "italics" (slanted):  one, two, three 

To make text in italics, use two apostrophes (') before and after the word.
 br 
For example:  nowiki ''Italic text'' nowiki  =  Italic text 

 Links to other Wikipedia pages 

To make a link to another Wikipedia page, put the name of the page inside two square brackets ([[).
 br 
For example:  nowiki [[London]] nowiki  =  London 

You can also make different words appear, other than the actual name of the linked article:  br 
 London The wonderful city of London  (this link is also to "London"). 
To do this, write:  nowiki [[London|The wonderful city of London]] nowiki 

Other letters added to the actual link will automatically appear as part of the link, like this: br 
 nowiki There are three [[London]]s  nowiki  =  There are three  London s. br 
 nowiki [[London]]ers nowiki  =  London ers.

 Links to other language Wikipedia pages 

On the left sidebar are links "in other languages", for example German ("Deutsch") and Catalan (Catala). The links are for the same article but in a different language. These links are updated from  Wikidata .

 Links to other pages not on Wikipedia 

To make a link to other websites that are not on Wikipedia, write the address inside one square bracket ([), then after a single space, you can write a name for the page, then you have to close the word again with another bracket: ].
 br 
For example:  nowiki [http://www.google.co.uk Google] nowiki  =  http://www.google.co.uk Google 
 br 

To link to the  Simple English Wiktionary  for a word, write  nowiki [[wikt:wantedword|wantedword]] nowiki .  (Note that  nowiki [[wiktionary:wantedword|wantedword]] nowiki  links to the EN Wiktionary instead.)
For example:  nowiki [[wikt:alternate|alternate]] nowiki  gives  wikt:alternate alternate .

 Minor (very small) edits (changes) 

When you save a page you can also say it is a "minor (small) change". This means a very small change, for example changing one or two words. When you look at  Special:Recentchanges Newest changes , you can choose if you want to see all the changes marked  m  for 'minor', or hide them.

It is not right to make a big change and mark it as a 'minor (small) change'. If this happens, it is best to explain that it was a mistake.

 Section headings 

The page you are reading now, "How to edit", has headings (titles). The first heading is "Making an encyclopedia page". Under that heading there is a smaller heading (a 'subheading'): "Bold text".

To make a big heading, write it in this way:

 nowiki ==Big heading== nowiki 

To make a smaller heading, write it in this way:

 nowiki ===Smaller heading=== nowiki 

To make an even smaller heading, write it in this way:

 nowiki ====Even smaller heading==== nowiki 

When you make four or more headings, Wikipedia automatically makes a table of contents - a list of all the headings - at the start of the page. You do not need to make the table, you only need to make the headings. Do not start the page by writing a heading. Write some general information first.

 Lists 

This is a list:
  Dogs
  Cats
  Birds

To make a list, write it in this way: br 
 nowiki * Dogs nowiki   br 
 nowiki * Cats nowiki   br 
 nowiki * Birds nowiki   br 

You can make lists in other lists:
  Dogs
  big dogs
 german shepherds
  small dogs
  poodles

Write different lists in this way: br 
 nowiki * Dogs nowiki   br 
 nowiki ** big dogs nowiki   br 
 nowiki *** german shepherds nowiki   br 
 nowiki ** small dogs nowiki   br 
 nowiki *** poodles nowiki   br 

 Making a space at the start of a line 

You can also make a space at the start of a line, like this:

Dogs
 big dogs
 small dogs
Cats

You can make a space in this way:

 nowiki :big dogs nowiki 

If you write more colons (:) there will be more spaces, like this:

Hi!
 Hi!
 Hi!
 Hi!
 Hi!
 Hi!
Hi!

 Putting text in the centre of the page 
 br 
 center This text is in the centre. center 

You can put text in the centre in this way:

 nowiki <center>This is in the centre</center> nowiki 

The code must use the American spelling (center) and not the British (centre), or it will not work.

 Making a line across the page 

Here is a line going across the page:

 

You can make a line with four hyphens (dashes), in this way:

 nowiki ---- nowiki 

 What are talk pages? 

One example of a talk page is  Talk:Light . On that page, people are talking about the article  Light . On a talk page, we talk to other people about the Wikipedia articles. 

If you have a problem with a page and you want to talk about it, click on "talk" at the top of the page.

When you write on a talk page, write your name. You can write your name automatically; write three tildes (~):

for example:  nowiki ~~~ nowiki  =  User:Saintswithin Saintswithin 

When you write four tildes, you also get the time:

for example:  nowiki ~~~~ nowiki  =  User:Saintswithin Saintswithin  21:45, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

When you write five tildes, you get just the time, without your name:

for example:  nowiki ~~~~~ nowiki  = 14:23, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
