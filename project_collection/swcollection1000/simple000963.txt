A common favorite of many is the  traditional   Scotland Scottish  Christmas cake, the "Whisky Dundee." It was named this because the cake came from Dundee and is made with Scotch  whisky . It is a  light  and crumbly cake, and light on  fruit  and  Candy candied  peel--only currants,  raisin s,  sultanas  and  cherry cherries .

As with all fruitcakes,  almond s (or other  nut (fruit) nut s) can be removed by people who do not like them or those with bad nut  allergies .

At the other end of the Christmas cake tradition, the  apple   cream  Christmas cake is a sweet mix of sliced apples, raisins and other fruit, with  egg (food) egg s,  cream cheese , and heavy whipping cream.
