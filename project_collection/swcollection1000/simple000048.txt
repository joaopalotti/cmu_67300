 Beekeeping  or  apiculture  is the  farming  of  honeybee s.

  Uses  
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for  honey . That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for  crop   pollination  and other products. These are  :wikt:wax wax  and  propolis .

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

  Types of beekeeping  
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a  hobby . Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that "city bees" are actually healthier than "rural bees" because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity. ref http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees ref 

 Threats 
 Colony Collapse Disorder  is a growing problem, along with  mite s.
