Internet slang

Some existing  acronym s, such as "AFK" (To mean "Away from keyboard") and "IRL" (To mean "In real life") were used on  bulletin board system s before the internet became popular. These are now used on the internet, such as in  chat room s and on  instant messaging instant messenger  software.

  Leet speak  
Leet speak (written as: L33T or 1337) is the most common  language  on  MMORPG s because rude words are not stopped by  filter s.
