Mexico is south of  Texas  and other American states.  Guatemala  and  Belize  are south of Mexico. Mexico is between the  Pacific Ocean  and the  Gulf of Mexico .

People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak  Spanish language Spanish . There are also Mexicans who speak  Native American  languages, like  Nahuatl ,  Maya languages Maya , and  Zapotec language Zapotec . The capital of Mexico is  Mexico City .

 History 

Before the Europeans came, many Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the  Olmec  culture in the south. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatan  peninsula  lived the  Mayans . The Mayans lived in  city states  ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between  200  and  900  A.D. Another powerful empire belonged to  Teotihuacan . Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest at that time. After Teotihuacan declined the  Toltecs  became powerful. Things made by the Toltecs have been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to  Costa Rica . A famous Toltec god is  Quetzalcoatl . The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the  Aztecs . The Aztecs called their own  empire  Mexico. A famous Aztec king was  Moctezuma II .

In  1519  the  Spain Spanish   explorer   Hernan Cortes  came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In  1521  they conquered the Aztec capital  Tenochtitlan . The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called  New Spain .

In  1810  the Mexican priest  Miguel Hidalgo  started the  Mexican war of independence . In  1821  the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was  Agustin de Iturbide . He set up the  First Mexican Empire  and became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in  1823  the country became a  republic .

A man who was very important in Mexico in the early  19th century  was  Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna . He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he became a  dictator ,  Texas  declared independence (1836). The  Battle of the Alamo  was part of this  Texas Revolution . Between 1846 and 1848 there was  Mexican-American War war between Mexico and the United States . In this war Mexico lost its large northern areas, which became the  southwestern United States . After this war Santa Anna was  exile sent away  to  Venezuela .

Between  1858  and  1861  there was war again, between  liberalism liberals  and  conservatism conservatives . The liberal  Benito Juarez  won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until  France  invaded Mexico and made  Maximilian of Habsburg  emperor of the Second Mexican Empire. But Maximilian was very unpopular. After  Cinco de Mayo more war  he was  death penalty executed  in  1867 , and Juarez became president again.

Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In  1876  they ousted him, and made  Porfirio Diaz , a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Diaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. Franciso I. Madero started the  Mexican Revolution  in  1910 .

The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are  Emiliano Zapata ,  Pancho Villa  and  Francisco I. Madero . When  Alvaro Obregon  became president in  1920  the fighting calmed down.

In  1929  President  Plutarco Elias Calles  founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed  Institutional Revolutionary Party , PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents were not popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president  Lazaro Cardenas . He was president between  1934  and  1940 .

After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the  Tlatelolco massacre . Another uprising was in  1994  when  Zapatista Army of National Liberation Zapatistas  rebelled in the province  Chiapas .

Mainly through ballot box  fraud  the PRI managed to stay into power until  2000 , when  Vicente Fox  of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years.

  Politics  

Mexico is a  constitution al  Federal republic federal   democracy  ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is  Enrique Pena Nieto . Parliament has a  Senate  and House of Deputies.
