Deadline

A  deadline  is a  time  by which some  :wikt:task task  must be  :wikt:complete complete d.

Very often, it means a  time limit  that is set in place by an  authority  - for example, a  teacher  tells students that they must turn in their  :wikt:homework homework  in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her  principal  that every  student  had the same chance to do the work.

Deadlines may also be set by a  time horizon  that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of  nature .  For example, by  sunset  one must do those tasks requiring  daylight .  However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the  Matter physical   horizon  where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.
