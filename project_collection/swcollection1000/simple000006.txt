Autonomous communities of Spain

Spain  is divided in 17 parts called  autonomous communities .  Autonomous  means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the  United States  of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In  1978  these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous community but six, which also have other official languages:
   Catalonia  ( Catalan language Catalan  and  Occitan language Occitan )
   Valencia (autonomous community) Valencian Community  ( Catalan language Catalan , also called  Valencian language Valencian  there)
   Balearic Islands  ( Catalan language Catalan )
   Galicia  ( Galician language Galician )
   :en:Basque_Country Basque Country  ( Basque language Basque )
   Navarre  ( basque language Basque , but only in the north and near the border with Euskadi)
