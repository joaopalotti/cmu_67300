 Native Americans  (also called  Aboriginal Americans ,  American Indians ,  Amerindians , or  Indigenous Peoples of America ) are the people, and their descendants, who were in  North America ,  Central America ,  South America , and the  Caribbean  Islands when Europeans arrived. There are many different  tribe s of Native American people, with many different languages. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined. Approximately 51 million Native Americans live in  Latin America .

Sometimes these people are called "Indians", but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from  India . When  Christopher Columbus  was travelling  West , he did not know about the  Americas . He thought he was going to  India , so he called the people "Indians". 

Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from  disease s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Native Americans, in  battle  with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as  slave s. Most of the native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from  Asia . Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when  Alaska  was connected to  Siberia  by the  Bering land bridge .

Some Native American tribes of North America are  Cherokee ,  Maya people Maya  or  Yucatec ,  Aztecs ,  Navajo people Navajo , and  Sioux . 

Some Native American tribes of South America are  Aymara people Aymara ,  Guarani people Guarani ,  Quechua , and  Tupi .
