Basket

File:Baskets four styles.jpg thumb|Four kinds of baskets. 
A  basket  is a  container . It is usually light.

Basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket, such as bark, willow rods, leaves, wire, plastic, paper, and rope.  There are three basic kinds of baskets--coiled, twined, or woven.  A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers:  the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes. A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring. Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns. 

Basketmaking is so old that it features in myths from various cultures.  Baskets are used to carry babies, plants, fruit, cotton, and Easter eggs.  Coroners once used a basket coffin to collect bodies, thus the expression "a basket case" which meant the person was dead.
