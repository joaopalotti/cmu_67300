  Rotation  
A Martian day is called a  sol , and is a little longer than an Earth day.  Mars rotates in 24 hours, and 37 minutes. It rotates on a  wikt:tilt tilt , just like the Earth does, so it has four different  season s. Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's, as Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long.

Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the  Deposition (geology) deposition  of 25-30% of the atmosphere into slabs of  Carbon dioxide CO sub 2 sub  ice ( dry ice ). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO sub 2 sub   Sublimation sublimes  (turns to vapor), creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km/h. Each season this moves large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large  cirrus cloud s and dust storms. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the  Opportunity rover Opportunity  rover in 2004.

The polar caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. ref name nasa070315 

  Atmosphere  
Mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen (it is mostly  carbon dioxide ). Because there is an  atmosphere , however thin it is, the sky does change colour when the sun rises and sets. The dust in the Martian atmosphere make the Martian sunsets have a rather  blue  colour. Mars's atmosphere, of course, is too thin to protect Mars from  meteor s, which is why the lower half of Mars has so many craters. 

  Meteorite craters  
After the formation of the planets, all experienced the " Late Heavy Bombardment ". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era. ref name barlow88 Barlow N.G. 1988.

Some meteorites hit Mars with so much force a few pieces of Mars went flying into space  ndash  even to Earth! Rocks on Earth are sometimes found which have chemicals that are exactly like the ones in Martian rocks. These rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere, so it is  wikt:reasonable reasonable  to think they came from Mars.

  Geography  
Mars is home to the highest known mountain in the Solar System,  Olympus Mons . Olympus Mons is about 17 miles (or 27 kilometers) high. This is more than three times the height of Earth's tallest mountain,  Mount Everest . It is also home to  Valles Marineris , the third largest  Rift (geology) rift  system (canyon) in the Solar System, 4,000 km long.

The first observations of Mars by  telescope  was by  Galileo Galilei  in 1610. Within a century, astronomers discovered distinct  albedo  features (changes in brightness) on the planet, including the dark patch and polar  ice cap s. They were able to find the planet's day ( rotation period ) and  axial tilt . ref name jbaa94 cite journal   last Moore   first P.   year 1984   title The mapping of Mars   journal Journal of the British Astronomical Association   volume 94   issue 2   pages 45-54   bibcode 1984JBAA...94...45M  ref ref name sheehan_ch2 cite web   first William   last Sheehan   year 1996   title Chapter 2: pioneers   work The planet Mars: a history of observation and discovery   publisher University of Arizona   url http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/chap02.htm    accessdate 2010-01-16  ref 

Better telescopes developed early in the 19th century allowed permanent Martian  albedo  features to be mapped in detail. The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by better maps from 1877 onward. Astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the  Spectroscopy spectroscopic  mark of water in the Martian atmosphere, and the idea of life on Mars became  wikt:popularise popular  among the public.  Percival Lowell  believed he could see an artificial network of  canal s on Mars. These linear features later proved to be an  optical illusion , and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an Earth-like  environment , including surface water.

Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from  ndash 85 to 7  sup o sup C. The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only traces of oxygen and water. In 1947,  Gerard Kuiper  showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive  carbon dioxide ; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard naming of Mars surface features was set in 1960 by the  International Astronomical Union . 

Since the 1960s, multiple robotic  spacecraft  and  rover (space exploration) rovers  have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the  electromagnetic spectrum  (visible light, infrared and others). The discovery of  meteorite s on Earth that came from Mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.

During the 1877 opposition, Italian astronomer  Giovanni Schiaparelli  used a  convert 22 cm abbr on  telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. What caught people's attention was that the maps had features he called  canali .  These were later shown to be an  optical illusion  (not real). These  canali  were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term  canali  was popularly mistranslated in English as  canals , and thought to be made by intelligent beings. ref name milone_wilson08 cite book   last1 Milone   first1 Eugene F.   last2 Wilson   first2 William J.F.   title Background science and the inner Solar System   page 228   volume 1   series Solar System Astrophysics   publisher Springer   year 2008   isbn 0-387-73154-7   url http://books.google.com/books?id=CX040NargCEC&pg=PA228   ref ref name sagan80 cite book   last Sagan   first Carl   title Cosmos   publisher Random House   year 1980   page 107   isbn 0-394-50294-9   url http://books.google.com/books?id=1gR8lSPrPq4C&pg=PA107   ref

Because Mars is the one of the closest planets to  Earth  in the  Solar System , many have wondered if there is any kind of  life  on Mars. Today we know that the kind of life, if any, would be some simple  bacteria -type organism. 

  Meteorites  
 NASA  maintains a catalog of 34 Mars  meteorite s, that is, meteorites which originally came from Mars. ref Cite web url http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/index.html title Mars Meteorites accessdate February 16, 2010 publisher NASA ref  These assets are highly valuable since they are the only physical samples available of Mars. 

Studies at NASA's  Johnson Space Center  show that at least three of the meteorites contain possible evidence of past life on Mars, in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria (so-called  Organism biomorphs ). Although the scientific evidence collected is reliable, and the rocks are correctly described, what made the rocks look like they do is not clear. To date, scientists are still trying to agree if it really is evidence of simple life on Mars. ref name meteoritos-Bio http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf Evidence for ancient Martian life . Gibson E. K. Jr.  et al  Mail Code SN2, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston TX 77058, USA. ref 

Over the past few decades, scientists have agreed that when using meteorites from other planets found on Earth (or rocks brought back to Earth), various things are needed to be sure of life. Those things include: ref name meteoritos-Bio 

 Did the rock comes from the right time and place on the planet for life to exist?	
 Does the sample contain evidence of  bacterial   cells  (does it show fossils of some kind, even if very tiny)?
 Is there any evidence of biominerals? ( minerals  usually caused by living things)
 Is there any evidence of  isotope s typical of life?
 Are the features part of the meteorite, and not contamination from Earth? 

For people to agree on past life in a geologic sample, most or all of these things must be met. This has not happened yet, but investigations are still in progress. ref name meteoritos-Bio  Reexaminations of the biomorphs found in the three Martian meteorites are underway. ref http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1001/09marslife/ ref 

  The significance of water  
Liquid water is necessary for life and  metabolism , so if water was present on Mars, the chances of life evolving is improved. The Viking orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas, erosion and, in the southern hemisphere, branched streams. ref Strom R.G., Steven K. Croft, and Nadine G. Barlow 1992.  The Martian impact cratering record .University of Arizona Press. ISBN 0-8165-1257-4 ref ref Raeburn P. 1998. Uncovering the secrets of the red planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C. ref ref Moore P.  et a  1990.  The Atlas of the Solar System . Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY. ref  Since then, rovers and orbiters have also looked closely and eventually proved water was on the surface at one time, and is still found as ice in the polar ice caps and underground.

  Today  
So far, scientists have not found life on Mars, either living or  extinct . Several  space probe s have gone to Mars to study it. Some have  orbit ed (gone around) the planet, and some have landed on it. There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by the probes. Some people are interested in sending  astronaut s to visit Mars. They could do a better search, but getting astronauts there would be difficult and expensive. The astronauts would be in space for many years, and it could be very dangerous because of  radiation  from the sun.  So far we have only sent unmanned probes.  

The most recent probe to the planet is the  Mars Science Laboratory .  It landed on  Aeolis Palus  in Gale Crater on Mars on 6 August 2012. ref name Space-20120806 cite web  last Wall  first Mike  title Touchdown!

It is the most advanced space probe ever. Curiosity has dug up Martian soil and studied it in its laboratory. It has found  sulfur ,  chlorine , and water molecules. ref Mars Science Laboratory.

  Popular culture  
 main Mars in fiction 
Some famous stories were written about this idea. The writers used the name " Martian s" for  intelligent   being s from Mars. In 1898,  H. G. Wells  wrote  The War of the Worlds , a famous  novel  about Martians attacking the Earth. ref name pc cite web url http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/mystique/literature/ title Pop Culture Mars: Literature publisher NASA accessdate 2011-10-25 ref   In 1938,  Orson Welles  broadcast a  radio  version of this story in the  United States , and many people thought it was really happening and were very afraid. ref name pc2 cite web url http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/mystique/filmradio/ title Pop Culture Mars: Film & Radio publisher NASA accessdate 2011-10-25 ref  Beginning in 1912,  Edgar Rice Burroughs  wrote several novels about adventures on Mars.
