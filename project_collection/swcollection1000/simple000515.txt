 about the  planet other uses Venus (disambiguation) 
 Venus  is the second  planet  from the  sun . ref in our  Solar System ref  It is a  terrestrial planet  because it has a solid,  Rock (geology) rocky  surface like other planets in the inner solar system. Astronomers have known Venus for thousands of years. The  Ancient Rome ancient Romans  named it after their  god dess  Venus (mythology) Venus . Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for  the Moon . It is sometimes called the  morning star  or the  evening star  as at some  elongation s it is easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning and, at other elongations, just after the sun goes down in the evening. Venus comes closer to the  Earth  than any other planet does.

Venus is sometimes called the  sister  planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and  gravity . In other ways the planets are very different. Venus'  atmosphere  (air) is mostly  carbon dioxide  with clouds of  sulfuric acid sulphuric acid . ref citeweb url http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/venus/atmosphere.html title The Atmosphere of Venus ref  Sulphuric acid is a  chemical  that is very  poison ous to  human s. 

The thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface, and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might  life live  there. The  pressure  on Venus' surface is 92 times that of Earth. Venus has no  Satellite (natural) moons .  Venus spins very slowly on its axis and it spins in the  Retrograde and direct motion opposite direction  to the other planets.

  Physical Properties  
 File:Venus globe.jpg thumb|left| Radar  view of the surface of Venus ( Magellan spacecraft ) 
Venus is a terrestrial planet so, like the Earth, its surface is made of rock. Venus is much hotter than Earth. All the  carbon dioxide  in the atmosphere acts like a  blanket , trapping heat from the Sun. This effect is called the  greenhouse effect  and it is very strong on Venus. This makes the surface of Venus the hottest of any planet's surface in the Solar System with an  estimate d  average   temperature  of  convert 480 degC degF 1 . ref citeweb url http://filer.case.edu/sjr16/advanced/venus.html title Venus - an overview ref ref citeweb url http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/GeorgeRyabov.shtml title Temperature on the Surface of Venus ref  This is hot enough to  melting melt   lead  or  zinc .

  Geography  
Venus has no oceans because it is much too hot for water. Venus' surface is a dry desert. Because of the clouds, only  radar  can map the surface. It is about 80% smooth,  Rock (geology) rocky   plain s, made mostly of  basalt . Two higher areas called  continent s make up the north and south of the planet. The north is called  Ishtar Terra  and the south is called  Aphrodite Terra . They are named after the  Babylon ian and  Greek god desses of love. ref Batson R.M., Russell J.F. (1991),  Naming the Newly Found Landforms on Venus , Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, v. 22, p. 65 ref 

  Atmosphere  

Venus'  atmosphere  is mostly  carbon dioxide  and  nitrogen   gas  with  cloud s of  sulphuric acid . Because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the  pressure  is very high. The pressure is 92 times the pressure on Earth, enough to crush many things.

It is impossible to see the planet's surface from  Outer space space  as the thick  cloud  layer  reflection reflects  60% of the light that hits it. The only way scientists are able to see it is by using  infrared  and  UV ultraviolet   camera s and  radar .

 Transit of Venus 
 main Transit of Venus 

Venus can sometimes be seen passing between the sun and earth. Venus looks like a black dot when seen through a special telescope. These "transits" happen in pairs eight years apart. Then it's more than a hundred years to the next pair.
