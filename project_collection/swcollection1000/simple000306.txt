A  first language  (also  mother tongue ,  native language ,  arterial language , or  L1 ) is the language a person first learns. ref Bloomfield, Leonard.  http://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&dq Language  ISBN 81-208-1196-8 ref  A person's first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language. ref http://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&dq Alan Davies. The native speaker: myth and reality.  ISBN 1-85359-622-1 ref 

Sometimes  first language  means the language a person speaks best (his  second language  is the language he speaks less well than his first language, etc.).  In this case  first language ,  second language  and  third language  show how well one speaks a language, so a person can have more than one first language or second language.
