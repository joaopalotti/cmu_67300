The  Island of Hawai`i  is the largest of the  United States U.S.   Hawaiian Islands , and the most southern. Called locally the "Big Island," its area is 4,038 sq. miles (10 458 square kilometers).  The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150 km) across.
The Big Island makes up more than half (~62%) of the total land area of the   Hawaii State of Hawaii  and is governed by the  Hawaii County, Hawaii County of Hawaii .

The island is built from seven separate  shield volcano s that erupted more or less one at a time, one partly covering the other. The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones. These are (from oldest to youngest):  Kohala  ( extinct volcano extinct ),  Mauna Kea  ( Dormant volcano dormant ),  Hualalai  (dormant),  Mauna Loa  ( Active volcano active ), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and  Kilauea  (very active). The volcanos, and the islands, were the result of the Pacific oceanic  tectonic  plate moving over a  Hotspot (geology) hotspot . There  lava  from the Earth's lower  Earth's mantle mantle  or upper  Earth's core core  is close to the surface.

The largest city on the island is  Hilo . Hilo is filled with historic buildings, interesting shops, parks and has a constant stream of performances, festivals and events. It is on the rainy east side of the  island . The city of  Kailua-Kona  is on the  :wikt:dry dry  west side of Hawaii, and is popular with  tourists .
