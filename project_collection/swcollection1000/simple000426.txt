monththisyear 9 
 September  is the ninth  month  of the  year  in the  Gregorian calendar , coming between  August  and  October . It has 30  day s. Its name comes from the  Latin  word  sept  for "seven" (it was the seventh month of the year, before  January  and  February  were added to the beginning of the year.)

September always starts on the same day of the week as  December , but never ends on the same day of the week as another month.

In the old  Roman calendar , September was the  Seven seventh  month, which is where it got its name ("Septem" means "seventh"). The ninth month at the time was  November  ("Novem" means "ninth"). With  Julius Caesar 's  calendar  reform, September became the ninth month, with 30 days. September comes after  August  and before  October .

September begins on the same day of week as  December  every year, as each day in September and its equivalent in  December  are 91  day s (13  week s) apart. No other month in any year,  Common year common  or  leap year , ends on the same day of the week as September.  May  is the other of two months to have this feature.

In  common year s, September starts on the same day of the week as  April  and  July  of the preceding year and ends on the same day of the week as  April  and  December  of the preceding year; September of a leap year and a year that follows a leap year starts on the same day of the week as  January  of the preceding year, while in  Leap year leap years , September starts on the same day of the week as  October  and ends on the same day of the week as  July , both of the preceding year.

During years that precede a  common year , September starts on the same day of the week as  June  of the following year, and ends on the same day of the week as  March  and  June  of the following year; during years that precede a  leap year , then September starts on the same day of the week as  March  and  November , and ends on the same day of the week as  August  and  November , both of the following year.

An  equinox  occurs in September, either on the  September 22 22 nd or  September 23 23 rd, meaning there are days and nights of about equal length, half way between the  June  and  December   solstice s. In the  Northern Hemisphere ,  Autumn  (Fall) begins in this month, while in the  Southern Hemisphere , this is the beginning of  Spring . For  Meteorology meteorologists , the people who study the  weather , these seasons begin on  September 1  in those  hemisphere s. In both hemispheres, it is the seasonal equivalent of  March  in the other. In most Northern Hemisphere countries,  school  starts in this month, following the  summer  holidays.

In  Ancient Greece , September was called  Boedromion . The  Anglo-Saxons  called it  Gerstmonath , meaning " Barley  month", referring to the  harvest . In other countries, it is referred to as  Autumn Month , such as in  Finland  (Syyskuu) and German-speaking parts of  Switzerland  (Herbstmonat).

 Ethiopia n  New Year  occurs in September.  Judaism Jewish  New Year also often occurs in this month.
