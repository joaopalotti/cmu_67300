It grows best in  subtropical  (wet and always warm) climates. It needs well-drained  soil  (water can flow away easily) and  convert 40 to 100 in mm  of rain a year.

The nutmeat (the soft part inside the shell that can be eaten) is mostly a creamy white color. Sometimes it looks a bit yellow. It has a  flavor  that many people like.
