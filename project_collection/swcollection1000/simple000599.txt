  History  
The Nationalists, led by Dr.  Sun Yat-sen , got rid of the  Qing Dynasty  ruled by the  Manchu s, then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late-1911. The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia.

After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during  World War II , Taiwan was controlled by the ROC.

In 1949, the  Communist Party of China Chinese Communists  fought a  civil war war  against the Nationalists and won. They established the  People's Republic of China . The Nationalists left mainland China and arrived in Taiwan.

  Politics  
After the ROC created a base on Taiwan, it hoped one day to capture the Mainland. But Chinese Communists grew stronger, so the Nationalists never did go back. The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own.

There are those people in Taiwan who want to never be a part of the  People's Republic of China .  They believe in complete  Taiwan independence  and want to rename the ROC (Taiwan) to "Republic of Taiwan" so Taiwan can no longer have any ancestral connection to China or Chinese culture. Some other people wish to unite with the People's Republic of China; they want  Chinese reunification . Some still want to attack the PRC and reunify China under the Republic of China. Some others want the  status quo , which means keeping everything the way it is now.

  Language  
Most Taiwanese people speak the  Standard Chinese language  known as  Mandarin language Mandarin , and others speak local dialects such as  Min Nan  (Taiwanese) or  Hakka language Hakka . The  Cantonese language , spoken in parts of southern China (for example, the province of  Guangdong ,  Hong Kong  and  Macau ), is not spoken in Taiwan. A small percentage of Aboriginal Taiwanese speak  aboriginal  languages, but the rest of the Chinese people have treated them badly, and many of these people, and their languages, struggle to survive. Some older Taiwanese people who went to school while the country was under Japanese rule can speak  Japanese language Japanese .

After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1948-49, they brought their language, Mandarin, with them, and made Mandarin the only official language. Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin. But, unlike the people in Mainland China, the Taiwanese never changed to  simplified Chinese characters  and so they have always used  traditional Chinese characters . In the past, students were not allowed to speak their  mother tongue  in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin. Taiwanese, Hakka, and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s, when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems. They were promoted, but by this time, many young people could speak only Mandarin.
