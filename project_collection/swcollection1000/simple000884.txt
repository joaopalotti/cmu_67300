 Scotland  ( Scottish Gaelic language Scottish Gaelic :  Alba ) is a  country  in the north-west part of Europe, and is one of  Countries of the United Kingdom the four countries  that make up the  United Kingdom . It is the northern half of the island of  Great Britain , with a  population  of about five  million . To the south of Scotland is the  border  with  England . Scotland has coasts on the  North Sea  to the east, the  Atlantic Ocean  to the west and the  Irish Sea  to the south-west.

Scotland was once an independent country and had its own  monarch , but is now in a union with England,  Wales  and  Northern Ireland , which we now call the United Kingdom. In 1603, the  King  of Scotland,  James I of England James VI , became King of England too, because Queen  Elizabeth I  of England died.  In 1707, the  parliament of Scotland  joined with the  parliament of England  to become the  Parliament of Great Britain .

Even though Scotland is not independent, throughout history it has had its own legal system and culture. ref name administrative control Devine, T. M. (1999),  The Scottish Nation 1700-2000 , P.288-289, ISBN 0-14-023004-1  "created a new and powerful  local state  run by the Scottish bourgeoisie and reflecting their political and religious values. It was this local state, rather than a distant and usually indifferent Westminster authority, that in effect routinely governed Scotland" ref  Since 1999, Scotland has had its own  parliament , the  Scottish Parliament .  It was  devolution devolved  from the  Parliament of the United Kingdom British parliament , which still controls many things regarding Scotland.

On 18 September 2014, a  referendum  on  independence  from the United Kingdom took place. A majority (55%) voted to stay in the United Kingdom.  ref name bbc-result cite news title In maps: How close was the Scottish referendum vote? url http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29255449 accessdate 8 December 2014 agency BBC News date 19 September 2014 ref ref cite web url http://news.sky.com/story/1067962/scotland-names-the-day-for-independence-vote   title Scotland: Independence Referendum Date Set  publisher BSkyB  date 21 March 2013  accessdate 4 May 2013 ref 

The Scottish flag is blue with a white diagonal cross (called a  saltire ). This is the cross of  Saint Andrew , who is the  patron saint  of Scotland. Some other symbols used for Scotland are a  thistle , and a  lion  rampant.

The  capital city  of Scotland is  Edinburgh  on the east coast, but the biggest city is  Glasgow  on the west coast. Other cities in Scotland are  Aberdeen ,  Dundee ,  Inverness ,  Perth, Scotland Perth  and  Stirling .

  Geography  
The main part of Scotland makes up  1/3  of the size of the  British Isles , and is to the  northwest  of mainland  Europe .

The size of the land of Scotland is 78,772 km 2 (30,414  mile sq mi ). ref name Whitaker Whitaker's Almanack  (1991) London. J. Whitaker and Sons. ref  Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96  kilometres  (60  mile mi ) across. The  Atlantic Ocean  borders the west coast and the  North Sea  is to the east. The island of  Ireland  is only 30  kilometre s (20  miles mi ) from the southern part of  Kintyre ref http://www.britannica.com/place/North-Channel-strait North Channel , Encyclopedia Britannica.  Retrieved 2016-05-02. ref ,  Norway  is 305 kilometers (190 mi) to the east and the  Faroe Islands  are 270 kilometres (168 mi) to the north.

The north of Scotland has many mountains, and few people live there. Most people live in the lowlands ( Edinburgh , Glasgow ,  Aberdeen  and  Dundee ), or around the coast. South of the central belt are the  Southern Uplands , another hilly place. On the west coast and in the north are a lot of  island s. The tallest mountain in Scotland is  Ben Nevis , which is also the tallest mountain in the  British Isles . ref http://visit-fortwilliam.co.uk/ben-nevis-in-fort-william-the-most-popular-mountain-in-the-uk Visit Fort William - About Ben Nevis  Accessed 7/11/11 ref 

  History  
 File:Stirlingcastle.jpg thumb|right| Stirling Castle  has stood for centuries on top of a volcanic crag. It defended the lowest ford of the  River Forth .  The castle underwent many  siege s. 

The history of Scotland begins around 12,800 years ago, when  human s first began to live in Scotland after the end of the last  ice age . ref The earliest known evidence is a flint arrowhead from  Islay . See Moffat, Alistair (2005)  Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History . London. Thames & Hudson. Page 42. ref ref Sites at  Cramond  dated to 8500 BC and near  Kinloch Castle Kinloch ,  Rum  from 7700 BC provide the earliest known evidence of human  u occupation u  in Scotland.

Retrieved 10 February 2008 and Edwards, Kevin J. and Whittington, Graeme "Vegetation Change" in Edwards, Kevin J. & Ralston, Ian B.M. (Eds) (2003)  Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC-AD 1000 . Edinburgh.  Edinburgh University Press . Page 70. ref  Of the  Stone Age ,  Bronze Age , and  Iron Age   civilization  that existed in the country, many  fossil s remain, but no written records were left behind. These people did not have  writing .

The written history of Scotland begins when the  Roman Empire  came to Britain, and the Romans invaded what is now  England  and  Wales , calling it  Roman Britain Britannia . To the north was  Caledonia , land not owned by the Romans. Its people were the  Picts . This meant the Scottish were not affected by the Romans in the same way the English were. The sea was very important for trade reasons.

Because of where Scotland is in the world and its strong  wikt:reliance reliance  on trade routes by sea, the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries, and through Ireland with France and Europe. Following the  Acts of Union 1707 Acts of Union  and  Industrial Revolution , Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial, intellectual and industrial states in Europe.

 Wars of Independence 
 File:William Wallace.jpg Sir William Wallace|thumb|right 
 main Wars of Scottish Independence 
The  Wars of Scottish Independence  were many military  campaign s fought between  Scotland  and  England  in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.

The First War (1296-1328) began with the  Kingdom of England English  invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the  Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton  in 1328. The Second War (1332-1357) began with the  England English -supported invasion of Scotland by  Edward Balliol  and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of  Berwick-upon-Tweed Berwick .

The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland still was a free and independent country, which was its main aim throughout the conflict. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the invention of the  longbow  as an important weapon in  medieval warfare .

A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s, followed by King  Alexander III of Scotland Alexander III 's death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in crisis. His granddaughter,  Margaret I of Scotland Margaret, the "Maid of Norway" , a four-year old girl, was the heir.

 Edward I of England , as Margaret's great-uncle, suggested that his son (also a child) and Margaret should marry, stabilising the Scottish line of succession. In 1290 Margaret's guardians agreed to this, but Margaret herself died in  Orkney  on her voyage from Norway to Scotland of  sea sickness  before she was made Queen, or her wedding could take place.

Because there was no clear heir to the throne anymore, the Scottish people decided to ask Edward I of England to choose their king. The strongest candidate was called  Robert Bruce . Robert Bruce had castles all around the country, and had a private army. But Edward wanted to invade Scotland, so he chose the weaker candidate, who was  John I of Scotland John Balliol . He had the strongest claim to the throne, and became king on 30 November 1292. Robert Bruce decided to accept this decision (his grandson and   wikt:namesake namesake  later took the throne as Robert I).

 File:SterlingBridge.jpg thumb|right|Stirling Bridge in 2006 
Over the next few years, Edward I kept trying to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295, John, on the recommendation of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with  France . This was the beginning of the  Auld Alliance .

In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland. He removed King John from power, and put him in jail. The following year  William Wallace  and  Andrew de Moray  raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to fight the English. Under their joint leadership, an English army was defeated at the  Battle of Stirling Bridge . For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm.

Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the  Battle of Falkirk  in 1298. Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland.  John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch John Comyn  and  Robert I of Scotland Robert the Bruce  were put in his place. In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English, who executed him for treason. Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he was not loyal to England.
 File:Robert the Bruce.jpg Robert Bruce|thumb|200px|right 

In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn, a leading rival, in a  church . Bruce went on to take the crown, but Edward's army overran the country yet again after defeating Bruce's small army at the  Battle of Methven . Despite the  excommunication  of Bruce and his followers by  Pope Clement V , his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314, with the help of leading nobles such as  Sir James Douglas  and the  Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray Earl of Moray , only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control.

Edward I died in  Carlisle  in 1307. His heir,  Edward II of England Edward II , moved an army north to break the siege of  Stirling Castle  and again take control. Robert defeated that army at the  Battle of Bannockburn  in 1314, securing temporary independence. In 1320, a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland (the  Declaration of Arbroath ) went part of the way towards convincing  Pope John XXII  to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's independence could be recognised by other European countries.

In 1326, the first full  Parliament of Scotland  met. The parliament was made from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235, but in 1326 representatives of the burghs -- the burgh commissioners -- joined them to form the Three Estates.

In 1328,  Edward III of England Edward III  signed the  Treaty of Northampton  which declared Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. Four years after Robert's death in 1329, England invaded Scotland yet again, looking to put the "Rightful King" --  Edward Balliol , son of John Balliol -- to the Scottish throne, starting the Second War of Independence. In the face of tough Scottish resistance, led by  Sir Andrew Murray , attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the  Hundred Years' War  with France.  In 1341  David II of Scotland David II , King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his empty claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364.

  The Norse  
Most of the Scottish islands were ruled by the  Norse  (and then by  Norway Norwegians  and  Denmark Danes ) for over four hundred years. This includes the  Hebrides  to the west and  Orkney  and  Shetland  to the north. The islands still have a culture of their own.  St Kilda ,  Heart of Neolithic Orkney  and  Skara Brae  are all  World Heritage Site s, as are the  Antonine Wall  and  New Lanark  on the mainland.

  Since 1603  
In 1603, Queen  Elizabeth I of England  died and, because she did not have any children,  James VI of Scotland  (son of  Mary, Queen of Scots ) also became King  James I of England . In 1707, Scotland and England were joined in the  Act of Union  to make one big Kingdom, the  Kingdom of Great Britain . When  Ireland  joined in 1801, the  United Kingdom  was created.

In  1997 , a majority of voters in Scotland chose to have their own  Scottish Parliament , which was set up in  1999 . Former  First Minister of Scotland   Alex Salmond  led the  Scottish National Party  to government in Scotland in  2007  and won an overall majority in  2011 , taking 69 out of 129 seats. The  Scottish independence referendum, 2014  ended in a majority (55%) voting against independence from the  United Kingdom . Alex Salmond resigned shortly after and was succeeded by  Nicola Sturgeon  on 19 November 2014.

The  Scottish National Party  won 56 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the  House of Commons  in the  United Kingdom general election, 2015 , while the  Conservative Party (UK) Conservatives  won an overall majority. Scotland had traditionally voted for the  Labour Party  in general elections before then.
