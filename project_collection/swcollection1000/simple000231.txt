 Ink  is a  liquid  that is used to  write ,  draw , print, or make marks. The word ink is from  Latin language Latin  and means "colored water". Ink is used in  pen s, in some computer printers, and in  printing press es. In some countries, people write by using ink and  brush es. People usually write or print using black ink, but ink can be any  color . The first ink was used in  Egypt  about 2600 BC.

A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet, spoiling the picture or writing. 

The first inks were carbon inks, made from soot, which is 80%  carbon , water and  gum arabic . Red ink would need  iron oxide  (such as  haematite ) from ground rocks instead of soot. Later, in Europe, people used iron gall ink. This is the kind of ink  Johann Sebastian Bach  and  Leonardo da Vinci  used. Now ink colours are produced by  dye s.

Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long  cylinder  (tube) inside the pen. The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube.
