Sail

Image:Freiheitu.jpg thumb|Sailing boat 
A  sail  is a large piece of  cloth  on the top of some  boat s. The  wind  goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the  water . The piece that the sail is attached to is called a  mast . Some boats have many sails, and some have only one. Usually, small boats have only one sail, and bigger boats have more. Boats with sails are called  sailing boats . There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails. 

Before people made boats with  engine s that used  coal  or  oil , sailing boats were an important way to travel across  ocean s. Now they are not so important for transport, but they are still used for  recreation  and  competition .

Modern sails can be classified into three main categories: 
  A  mainsail  is a sail located behind the main  mast (sailing) mast  of a sailing vessel. ref name oct cite book  last Torrey  first Owen C., Jr.  authorlink    title  Sails  publisher  Palmer & Oliver  volume    edition  Seamen's Bank for Savings  date  1965  location  New York  pages  7-9  isbn  ref 
  A  headsail  also known as the jib sail, is any sail set forward of the main mast.
  A  spinnaker  or downwind sail (also termed Kite). Special-purpose sails are often a variation of the three main categories.
  A  staysail  is a  fore-and-aft rig ged sail whose  luff (sail) luff  can be attached to a  forestay  running from a mast to the   bowsprit . ref cite web  url http://www.cruisingworld.com/how/rig-staysail   title Rig for a Staysail  author Don Street  date March 14, 2013  website   publisher Cruising World  accessdate December 29, 2016 ref 

High-performance yachts, in particular some catamarans such as the  International C-Class Catamaran , have used or use rigid wing sails, which are said to perform better than traditional soft sails. ref cite web url http://www.tspeer.com/ title Tom Speer - Home - publisher ref   In particular, a rigid wing sail was used by  Stars and Stripes (yacht)#Catamaran-hull yachts Stars and Stripes , the defender which won the  1988 America's Cup , and by  USA 17 (yacht) USA-17 , the challenger which won the  2010 America's Cup .

Most modern yachts, including  bermuda rig ,  ketch  and  yawl  boats, have a sail "inventory" which usually includes more than one of these types of sails. Although the mainsail is "permanently" hoisted while sailing, headsails and spinnakers can be changed depending on the particular weather conditions to allow better handling and speed.
