 Alan Mathison Turing   Order of the British Empire OBE   FRS  ( London , 23 June 1912 -  Wilmslow ,  Cheshire , 7 June 1954) was an  English people English   mathematician  and  computer scientist . He was born in  Maida Vale , London. ref Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912-1954.

  Young Life and Family  
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of  Merchant merchants  from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the  daughter  of an  engineer .

  Education  
Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.

  Career  
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first  computers . He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the  Turing machine  in 1936. The machine was  Imagination imaginary , but it included the idea of a  computer program . 

Turing was interested in  artificial intelligence . He proposed the  Turing test , to say when a machine could be called " Intelligence intelligent ". A computer could be said to "think" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine. ref Harnad, Stevan 2008.   http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence . In: Epstein, Robert & Peters, Grace (eds)  Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer . Springer ref 

During  World War II , Turing worked to break  Germany German   cipher s (secret messages). Using  cryptanalysis , he helped to break the codes of the  Enigma (machine) Enigma  machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the  ACE (computer) ACE  (Automatic Computing Engine) at the  National Physical Laboratory . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was "the first detailed design of a  stored-program computer ". ref Copeland, B. Jack 2006.  Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers . Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4 ref  Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the  Pilot ACE  was built without him. It ran its first program on 10 May 1950.

  Private life  
Turing was a  homosexual  man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in  England . At that time,  homosexual  acts were illegal. Turing was  conviction convicted . He had to choose between going to  jail  and taking  hormone s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones. ref cite web  title Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan  last Turing  first Alan  year 1952  url http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html   archivedate December 16, 2012  archiveurl http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9 ref  After his punishment, he became  erectile dysfunction impotent . He also grew  breast s. ref cite book   title Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition   publisher Princeton University   author Andrew Hodges   year 2012 ref

  Death  
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from  cyanide  poisoning. The cyanide came from either an  apple  which was poisoned with  cyanide , or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide. ref Hodges, Andrew 1983.  Alan Turing: the enigma . London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8 ref It is also suspected that he committed suicide. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against  medical ethics  and international laws of  human rights . In August 2009, a  petition  asking the  British Government  to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started. ref Cite book title Thousands call for Turing apology  url http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm   publisher BBC News   date 31 August 2009  accessdate 31 August 2009 ref ref Cite book   title   Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing   url    http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html    publisher CNN   date   01 September 2009   accessdate  1 September 2009 ref  The petition received thousands of signatures. ref The petition was only open to UK citizens. ref   Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Prime Minister   Gordon Brown  acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment "appalling". ref cite web   title   PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane   url    http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing    publisher The Guardian  date   11 September 2009  ref
