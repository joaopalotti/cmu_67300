Lanai

Lanai  (or  Lana`i ) is sixth largest of the  Hawaiian Islands , in the  United States . It is also known as the "Pineapple Island". The island is almost a circle in shape and is 18 miles wide in the longest direction. The land area is 140 sq. miles (367 km sup 2 sup ). It is separated from the island of  Moloka'i  by the  Kalohi Channel  to the north.

 History 
Lana'i was first seen by Europeans on 25 February  1779  by Captain Clerke, with  HMS Resolution  on the  James Cook  Pacific Ocean trip. Clerke took command of the ship after Capt. Cook was killed at  Kealakekua Bay  on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific. 

In  1922 ,  James Drummond Dole Jim Dole , the president of  Dole Food Company Dole Pineapple Company , bought the island of Lana'i. He made a large part of it into the world's largest  pineapple   plantation . 

 Tourism 
Tourism on Lana'i started not long ago. That was when the growing of pineapple was slowly coming to an end in the Islands. On Lana'i, you can be with nature and feel the mood of the Hawaiian countryside. Not like nearby  Oahu O'ahu , the only town (Lana'i City) is small. It has no traffic or shopping centers. Tourists come mainly to relax.

There are three hotels on Lana'i and several golf courses.
