Plastic

A  plastic  is a  material  that can change its shape, so many things can be made of plastic. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard. Others can be changed by heating them up or even by  melting  them. 

Most plastics are man-made; they do not occur in nature.  Most are made from  petroleum  or  natural gas .  The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called  plastic  are  polymer s. Polymers are long chains of  atoms  bonded to one another.

People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time.  Alexander Parkes , an English inventor (1813-1890), created the earliest form of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent, and he called it "Parkesine."

Plastic is filling up the landfills and sometimes if you burn it, it releases toxic fumes. If we  do not recycle, it becomes waste.

  Plastic Formulation  
Plastics are mostly  petrochemical s, made from  petroleum , a type of  oil .  Engineer s refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops  ethylene  and  propylene , which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a  polymer .

  Well-known plastics, and their use  
 Polyamide (usually called  nylon )  ndash  Women's  stocking s.
 Polycarbonate  -  bulletproof glass ,  compact disc s,  DVD s.
 Polyethylene  -  tube s made of plastic
 Polyethylene terephtalate  (called PET when used for  bottle s, and polyester when used for  clothes  or other materials)
 Polypropylene 
 Polystyrene 
 Polyurethane 
 Polyvinyl chloride  (called PVC, usually). Used for  Insulator (electricity) insulation  of electric wires, but also for pipes and road signs.
