The  Great Lakes  are five large  lake s in east-central  North America . They hold 21% of the world's  Surface area surface   fresh water . ref name EPA cite web url http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/basicinfo.html   title Great Lakes - U.S. EPA  publisher Epa.gov  date 2006-06-28  accessdate 2011-02-19  Note: by 'surface' is meant 'as measured by  surface area '. Measured by  volume  it would no doubt be a lesser figure. ref  

The lakes are:
   Lake Superior 
   Lake Michigan 
   Lake Huron 
   Lake Erie 
   Lake Ontario 

  Geography

Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between  Canada  and the  United States United States of America . The other, Lake Michigan, is completely inside the United States.

All together, by  volume , they are the largest group of  fresh water  lakes in the world. No one of the Lakes is larger than  Lake Baikal  ( Russia ) or  Lake Tanganyika  ( East Africa ). ref cite web url http://biology.usgs.gov/luhna/chap6.html   title LUHNA Chapter 6: Historical Landcover Changes in the Great Lakes Region  publisher Biology.usgs.gov  date 2003-11-20  accessdate 2011-02-19 ref ref cite book first Fereidoun last Ghassemi  year 2007 title Inter-basin water transfer  publisher Cambridge, Cambridge University

The cities of  Chicago ,  Illinois  (9.8 million people, on Lake Michigan),  Toronto ,  Ontario  (5.5 million, on Lake Ontario);  Detroit ,  Michigan  (5.3 million, on the Detroit river);  Montreal ,  Quebec  (3.9 million, on the  St. Lawrence River ),  Cleveland ,  Ohio  (2.9 million, on Lake Eyrie) and  Ottawa  (1.2 million, Ontario, on the Ottawa River) are on the shores of the Great Lakes or their rivers.

Though the five lakes have separate basins, they form a single, connected body of freshwater. The lakes connect the east-central interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean. Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron; then through the  Detroit River  into Lake Erie; then through  Niagara Falls  into Lake Ontario; and then through the  Saint Lawrence River  to the  Atlantic Ocean . Water also drains from the  Chicago River  on the south. ref group Note The Chicago River originally flowed into Lake Michigan.  The flow was artificially reversed to protect the quality of Chicago's drinking water that comes from Lake Michigan. ref 

Many rivers flow through a large  watershed  into the lakes. The lakes have about 35,000 islands. The Great Lakes region includes the five lakes and many thousands of smaller lakes, often called  inland lakes .

Lake Michigan and Lake Huron hit all-time record low levels in 2013. ref '' http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/lakes-michigan-huron-hit-record-low-level-dq8loc2-189903561.html Lakes Michigan, Huron hit record low water level  Feb. 5, 2013 ref 

The unusual shape of the Great Lakes has created the possibility of large waves called  seiche . If a  storm  causes a fast, strong increase in  air pressure  on one side of a lake, the water level on that side of the lake will drop and suddenly push up the water level on the opposite side of the lake.  A 10 foot tall wave in Chicago caused several deaths in 1954. ref cite web url http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1129.html title Seiches accessdate November 24, 2011 ref 

  Ecological threats  
The Great Lakes are home to a variety of species of fish and other organisms. In recent years,  overfishing  caused a decline in lake  trout . The drop in lake trout increased the  alewife  population. In response, the government introduced  salmon  as a predator to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the salmon population rose rapidly, and the states surrounding Lake Michigan promoted 'salmon snagging'. This has been made illegal in all of the Great Lakes states except for a limited season in Illinois. Lake Michigan is now being stocked with several species of fish. However, several invader species such as  lamprey s,  round goby , and  zebra mussel s threaten the native fish populations.

  Invasive species  
Accidentally  Invasive species introduced species  are a big problem. Since the 19th century about 160 species have invaded the Great Lakes ecosystem, causing severe economic and ecological impacts. ref name ISEA cite web  url http://www.greatlakeseducation.org/about_isea/?id=204   title Our threatened Great Lakes  accessdate 2007-11-30  publisher Inland Seas Education Association ref  According to the Inland Seas Education Association, they deprive fish of food, cause blooms of toxic  algae , and  foul  boats,  spawn ing areas and drinking water intakes. On average a new invasive species enters the Great Lakes every eight months. ref name ISEA 

Two important infestations in the Great Lakes are the  zebra mussel ,  first discovered in 1988, and the  quagga mussel  in 1989. fact date January 2012  These  mollusc s are efficient filter feeders. They compete with native  mussel s, and also reduce available food and spawning grounds for fish.  

Also, the mussels hurt utility and manufacturing industries by clogging or blocking pipes. The  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel will be about $5 billion over the next decade. ref cite web  url http://www.glc.org/ans/   title Great Lakes aquatic nuisance species  accessdate 2007-11-30  publisher Great Lakes Commission  date 2007-03-27 ref  Because the quagga mussel is good at filtering  plankton  from the lake water, sunlight reaches deeper into the lake. This increases the growth of algae. ref cite news url http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec11/mussels_11-23.html#transcript title Tiny mussels invade Great Lakes, threaten fishing industry date November 23, 2011 accessdate November 23, 2011 work PBS Newshour ref 

  Pollution  
Chemicals from industrial plants run off the land into rivers and arrive in the lakes. Some of these chemicals are highly  toxic , such as  Mercury (element) mercury .  Contaminated  water from  sewer  overflows also reaches the lakes, and beaches get closed because of the threat of  pathogen ic  bacteria . ref name ISEA
