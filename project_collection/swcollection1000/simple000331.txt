November is the eleventh  month  of the year in the  Gregorian calendar , after  October  and before  December , which is the last month. November has 30 days. It was the ninth month in the old  Roman calendar , which is where its name comes from. It kept its name when  January  and  February  were added to the beginning of the year, despite becoming the  eleven th  month . The ninth month is now  September .

November begins on the same day of the week as  March  every year, and also begins on the same day as  February  in  common year s. November ends on the same day of the week as  August  every year, as  August 31  and  November 30  are exactly 13  week s (91  day s) apart.

During a common year, November starts on the same day of the week as  June  and ends on the same day of the week as  March  and  June , both of the preceding year; during a leap year, November starts on the same day of the week as  September  and  December  and ends on the same day of the week as  September , both of the preceding year.

During years that precede common years, November starts on the same day of the week as  August  and ends on the same day of the week as  May , both of the following year; during years that precede leap years, November starts on the same day of the week as  May  and ends on the same day of the week as  February  and  October , both of the following year.

In the  Northern Hemisphere , November is an  Autumn  (Fall)  month , and the further north in the hemisphere, the more likely it is to get colder as  December  approaches. In the  Southern Hemisphere  it is a  Spring  month. In each  hemisphere , it is the  season al equivalent of  May  in the other.

Several observances around the beginning of the month are believed to be related, linked to the old  Celts Celtic  celebration of  Samhain  on  November 1 . These events include  Halloween  ( October 31 ),  Day of the Dead  in  Mexico  ( October 31  to  November 2 ),  All Saints Day  ( November 1 ) and All Souls Day ( November 2 ).
