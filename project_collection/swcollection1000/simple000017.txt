 Aquaculture  is the  farming  of  fish ,  shrimp , and  algae , and other seafood.  Aquaculture supplies fish, such as  catfish ,  salmon , and  trout . Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in  China  and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. 

Aquaculture is quite a new activity in  Canada  as it only began in  1879 .
