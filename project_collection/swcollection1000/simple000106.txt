A  circle  is a  round , regular,  2D two-dimensional  shape, shaped like a 2D sphere

The  wikt:centre centre  of a circle is the point in the very middle.

The  radius  of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side.  

All  point (geometry) point s on the edge of the circle are at the same  distance  from the centre.  In other words, the radius is the same length all the way around the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter  r  for the length of a circle's radius.

The  diameter  (meaning "all the way across") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter  d  for the length of this line.

The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius ( d  equals 2 times  r ).

d = 2\ r

The  circumference  (meaning "all the way around") of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter  C  for the length of this line.

The number  pi (mathematical constant) p  (written as the  Greek language Greek   letter   pi ) is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter ( p  equals  C  divided by  d ). As a  Fraction (mathematics) fraction  the number p is equal to about  frac 22 7   or 335/113 (which is closer) and as a number it is about 3.1415926535.

The  area ,  a , inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by p ( a  equals p times  r  times  r ).

 math A = \pi \, r^2  math 

 Calculating p 
 p  can be measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter ( d ) and circumference ( C ). This is because the circumference of a circle is always p times its diameter.

 math \pi = \frac{C}{d} math 

 p  can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods.  Most methods used for calculating the value of p have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing  trigonometry  and  calculus .  However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the  Gottfried Leibniz Gregory-Leibniz   series :

 math  \pi = \frac{4}{1}-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{4}{5}-\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{9}-\frac{4}{11}\cdots  math 

While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals p.  An easier to understand approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius  r  centered at the origin.  Then any point ( x , y ) whose distance  d  from the origin is less than  r , calculated by the  pythagorean theorem , will be inside the circle:

 math  d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} math 

Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area  A  to be estimated. For example, by using integer coordinates for a big  r . Since the area  A  of a circle is p times the radius squared, p can be approximated by using:

 math  \pi = \frac{A}{r^2}  math
