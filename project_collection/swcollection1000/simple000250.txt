  Moons  
 main Moons of Jupiter 

Jupiter has 67 known moons. ref name fact  The four largest were seen by  Galileo  with his primitive telescope, and nine more can be seen from Earth with modern telescopes. The rest of the moons have been identified by spacecraft. ref citeweb url http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html#JovianSystem title Jovian System publisher U.S. Geological Survey accessdate 2009-07-24 ref  The smallest moon ( S/2003 J 12 ) is only one  kilometre  across. The largest,  Ganymede , has a diameter of 5,262 kilometres. It is bigger than the planet  Mercury (planet) Mercury . ref cite web  url http://www.nineplanets.org/ganymede.html   title Ganymede  accessdate 2009-07-20  format   publisher Nine Planets  ref  The other three Galilean moons are  Io ,  Europa (moon) Europa  and  Callisto . Because of the way they orbit Jupiter,  gravity  affects three of these moons greatly. The  friction  caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most  volcanoes volcanic  object in the Solar System. It has over 400 volcanoes, more than three times as many as  Earth . ref cite web  url http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..169..140L   title Lava lakes on Io: observations of Io's volcanic activity from Galileo NIMS during the 2001 fly-bys  accessdate 2009-07-20  format   publisher Harvard University  ref 

  Jupiter in the Solar System  
 File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png thumb|A diagram of the inner Solar System. It shows the two groups of  Trojan asteroid s that follow Jupiter in its orbit 
Jupiter's large gravity has had a big effect on the  Solar System . Jupiter protects the inner planets from  comet s by pulling them towards itself. Because of this, Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System. ref name Shoemaker-Levy 

Two groups of  asteroid s, called  Trojan asteroid s, have settled into Jupiter's orbit round the Sun. One group is called the  Trojans  and the other group is called the  Greeks . They go around the Sun at the same time as Jupiter. ref cite journal   title Planetary science: The Trojan is out there   first Alison   last Wright   journal Nature Physics   volume 7   page 592   year 2011   doi 10.1038/nphys2061   date August 1, 2011   url http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v7/n8/full/nphys2061.html    accessdate 2011-08-12  bibcode   2011NatPh...7..592W  ref ref Robutel P. & Souchay J. 2010.
