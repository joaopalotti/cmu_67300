May

monththisyear 5 
 May  is the fifth  month  of the  year , coming between  April  and  June . It has 31  day s. The month of May might have been named for the  Roman mythology Roman goddess   Maia , or more likely the Roman  goddess  of  fertility   Bona Dea , whose festival was held in May.

May never starts nor ends on the same day of the week as another month.

May's  flower  is the  Lily of the Valley . Its  birthstone  is the  emerald . The meaning of the emerald is success in love.

  The Month

May comes between  April  and  June  and is the fifth month of the year in the  Gregorian calendar . It is one of seven months to have 31 days. In the older  Roman calendar , May was the third month of the year. It is a  spring  month in the  Northern Hemisphere  and an  autumn  month in the  Southern Hemisphere . May is likely to have been named after the Roman  God goddess   Maia , though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin "Maiores", meaning "Seniors". The same theory suggests that  June  would then be named from "Iuniores", meaning "Juniors".

No other month in any year,  Common year common  or  leap year , starts nor ends on the same day of the week as May. It is the only month to have both of these features.

May of a  common year  starts on the same day of the week as  August  of the preceding year, and ends on the same day of the week as  August  and  November  of the preceding year; May of a  leap year  and a year that follows a leap year starts on the same day of the week as February of the preceding year, while May of a  leap year  starts on the same day of the week as  March  and  November  of the preceding year and ends on the same day of the week as  March  and  June  of the preceding year.

May always starts and ends on the same day of the week as  January  of the following year: if that year is a common year, May of the current year starts on the same day of the week as  October  of the following year and ends on the same day of the week as  February  and  October  of the following year; if that year is a leap year, May of the current year starts on the same day of the week as  April  and  July  of the following year, and ends on the same day of the week as  July  of the following year.

In the  Northern Hemisphere , May is in late  Spring , and  May Day  on  May 1  and  Walpurgis Night , during the night of  April 30  to  May 1 , are symbolic of the transition from  winter  to  summer . In the  Southern Hemisphere , it is in  autumn , and comes just before the  Antarctica Antarctic  winter, when  emperor penguin s breed there.
