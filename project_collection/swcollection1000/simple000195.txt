 Gravity  holds galaxies together against the general  expansion of the universe . ref name cox1  In effect, the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies, not inside those groups. This is because the mass of a galaxy holds the galaxy together, and the same applies to the groups of galaxies, such as our  Local Group . The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a  centre of mass , which is also an effect of gravity.  

There are various types of galaxies:  Elliptical galaxy elliptical ,  Spiral galaxy spiral  and  lenticular galaxy lenticular  galaxies, which can all be with or without bars. Then there are  Irregular galaxy irregular  galaxies. All galaxies exist inside the  universe . There are probably over 170 billion (1.7x10 sup 11 sup ) galaxies within the  observable universe . ref name Gott Gott, J. Richard, III; et al. 2005. A map of the Universe.

 Description 
There are galaxies of different sizes. Typical galaxies range from  Dwarf galaxy dwarfs  with as few as ten million ref name cox1 ref name eso ESO 2000:  http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-12-00.html ref  (10 sup 7 sup ) stars up to giants with a hundred  trillion ref name cox1 ref name Wilford Wilford, John Noble 1990. "Sighting of largest galaxy hints at clues on the clustering of matter".  New York Times .  http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/us/sighting-of-largest-galaxy-hints-clues-on-the-clustering-of-matter.html. Retrieved 2010-05-06 ref  (10 sup 14 sup ) stars, all orbiting the galaxy's  center of mass . Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems,  star cluster s, and various  interstellar cloud s. The  Sun  is one of the stars in the  Milky Way  galaxy; the  Solar System  includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun.

Star clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies.  Globular clusters  are spherical tightly knit balls of stars which are part of the outer  halo  of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters,  Messier 15 , has several million stars, packed closely together, with a  black hole  at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies. 

Within  galaxy cluster s, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.

Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see above image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. 

In the  astronomy astronomical   literature , the word 'Galaxy' with a capital  G  is used for our galaxy, the  Milky Way . The billions of other galaxies are just written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase  g . The term  Milky Way  first came out in the English language in a poem by  Geoffrey Chaucer Chaucer .
