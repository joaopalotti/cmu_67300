 Harbour  means to shelter or keep safe. A  harbor  (or  harbour ) is a place where  ship s may shelter. A  port  is also a harbour, but is usually bigger.  The port will often contain a water space with  breakwarer s around the edge, a number of quays or  pier s where the ships may be moored or tied up and a  transport  system for taking goods inland. Often  railway  and  road transport  will be used.  Goods also move by  pipeline  transport and by smaller ships on rivers.

Harbors can be natural as in  San Francisco  or artificial as in ancient  Carthage  or a mix of both. During the  D-Day  operations of  1944 , two artificial harbors (named  Mulberry harbour mulberry ) were built just off the  beach es where the invasion was going to happen.
