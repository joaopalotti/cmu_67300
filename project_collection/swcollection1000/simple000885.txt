 Northern Ireland  ( lang-ga Tuaisceart Eireann , Ulster  lang-sco Norlin Airlann ) is a province of  Ireland . 

The whole island of Ireland used to be a  kingdom , called the  Kingdom of Ireland . But after the  Act of Union 1800 Act of Union  in the year 1800, it became part of the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . This stayed until 1922, after a  Irish War of Independence civil war , when Ireland was divided into the  Republic of Ireland , the  sovereign state  that takes up the southern part of the island, and Northern Ireland, which chose to stay as part of the UK.

About 1.8 million people live in Northern Ireland, and the  Capital city capital  and largest city is  Belfast .

Sometimes people use other names for Northern Ireland. Some call it  Ulster , even though some parts of Ulster are actually in the Republic of Ireland. Others call it "the North" or "the Six Counties", because they do not want to recognise that a part of the island of Ireland is not  independence independent  and is actually in the United Kingdom.

  Languages  
 English language English  is spoken by almost everyone in Northern Ireland. Another important  language  is  Irish language Irish  (sometimes called "Irish Gaelic") and a language known as  Ulster Scots , which comes from Eastern Ulster and Lowland Scotland. The Irish language became extinct in the 20th century, but a revival has led to some usage, especially in Belfast, the Glens of Antrim and counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. This revival has been driven largely through the creation of Irish-language schools. The Irish language is spoken by some nationalists (whether Catholic or Protestant) people. Ulster Scots is almost exclusive to areas of North Antrim and the Ards Peninsula.

Some languages like  Chinese language Chinese ,  Urdu  or  Polish language Polish  are becoming more common in Northern Ireland as people from other countries move to Northern Ireland.

  Belfast Agreement  
Since the  Belfast Agreement  (sometimes called the Good Friday Agreement) of Friday, 10 April  1998 , there has been mainly peace between the two sides of the community. This agreement was agreed by most of the people in Northern Ireland and the  Republic of Ireland , as well as the Irish and British governments. It allows for the self-government of Northern Ireland and greater North-South co-operation and co-operation between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. Additionally, it makes clear the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their constitutional future and select whether they are British citizens, Irish citizens or both.

 Sport 
The most popular sports in Northern Ireland are  association football ,  gaelic football  and  rugby union .  Track and field athletics Athletics ,  boxing ,  cricket ,  golf ,  hockey ,  hurling ,  snooker  and  motor sports  are also common. Most sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, and in international competitions, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland compete together as Ireland (e.g. Ireland national rugby union team, Ireland national cricket team). The main exception is football.

Football in Northern Ireland is governed by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In international competitions Northern Ireland has its own team - the  Northern Ireland national football team . The Northern Ireland team has qualified for three  FIFA World Cup s (in  1958 FIFA World Cup 1958 ,  1982 FIFA World Cup 1982  and  1986 FIFA World Cup 1986 ). Perhaps the most famous player from Northern Ireland was  George Best .

Track and field athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to compete either with athletes from Great Britain (as the team "Great Britain & Northern Ireland"), or with athletes from the rest of Ireland (as "Ireland").

Belfast is home to the Ulster Rugby team (which competes in the Pro 12 league and  Heineken Cup ), and the Belfast Giants  ice-hockey  team.
