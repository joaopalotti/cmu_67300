An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.

The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of  emotion . The artist may feel a certain emotion and feel that there is no way to express it other than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.Also,art is a way to express something which have a deep meaning inside.

 Islamic  art includes  geometric  patterns, Islamic  calligraphy , and  architecture . In  India  and  Tibet , painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included  jade  carving, bronzework,  pottery ,  poetry , calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the  Middle Ages , there was a " Renaissance " which means "rebirth". People rediscovered  science  and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like  Michelangelo  and  Leonardo da Vinci  still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented  perspective (graphical) perspective  where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In some  society societies , people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her " talent " into the art. In this view, the art is the  property  of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its  social capital  into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a  collective  that has made the art, through the artist.
