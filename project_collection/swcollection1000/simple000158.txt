Ecological yield

Ecological yield  is the harvestable  growth  of an  ecosystem .  It is most commonly measured in  forestry  - in fact  sustainable forestry  is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.

However, the concept is also applicable to  water , and  soil , and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called  renewable resource s.  The  carrying capacity  of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).
