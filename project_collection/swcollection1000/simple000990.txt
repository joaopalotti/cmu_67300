An  adjective  is a kind of  word  that modifies a  noun . Nouns are words that  name  a place, a person, a thing, or an idea. An adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it. It is a  part of speech . Adjectives are something that describes something and makes the thing sound better.

Often, the adjective is before the noun it describes.  Sometimes an adjective is not followed by a noun:
  The sky is  blue .
  The joke she told was so  funny , I could not stop laughing all day. 
  He went  crazy .

  It's still an adjective, because we could have "the blue sky", "the funny joke", and "the crazy man". The adjective is still describing the noun though they are not side by side.
  There is a  tall  man.
An adjective is a word that gives instant information about a noun to make a clear picture of the noun in the mind of the reader and create a feeling of the writer.

  Comparative and Superlative  

Sometimes there are different forms of the same adjective. If one joke makes a person laugh more than another joke, then that joke is  funnier . This is called the  comparative  form of the adjective. The day that is colder than any other is the  coldest  day. This is the  superlative  form of "cold". Some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them. For instance, one car may be  cheaper  than another, but the second car may be  more reliable . (We use "more reliable", instead of "reliabler".) Reliable means worthy of  trust .

The rule is:

For short adjectives ending in a  consonant  like "cold," "black," or "fast," one adds the  suffix   er  to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: "The North Pole is colder than Florida." The greatest possible comparison is made by adding the suffix  est . Example: "The North Pole is the coldest place on the Earth." For long adjectives like intelligent, conscientious, comprehensive, one uses the word  more  to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: "Children are more intelligent than adults." To make the greatest possible comparison one uses the word  most . Example: "She is the most conscientious person I have ever known."

  Nouns as noun modifiers  

In the English language, it is possible for a noun to modify (describe) another noun. Example: take the noun "angel" and the noun "face." Put them together and the result is "angel face." The first noun is acting like an adjective, because it is giving us information about the second noun.

  Adjectives and adverbs  
Adjectives are words we use to describe the noun. Simple words like sparkling and fat are both adjectives commonly used in writing. One can make  adverb s from some adjectives by adding the suffix  ly . Example: take the adjective "beautiful," the adverb is beautifully. One can do it the other way around: take an adverb like "presumably," the adjective is "presumable" (assumable). "Presumable innocence" means the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty (which is not always practiced everywhere, however).

The adjective "guilty" becomes the adverb "guiltily" and vice versa (the other way round)(the opposite), the adverb "guiltily" becomes the adjective "guilty." As a rule, "dogs chase cats" but not vice versa. Cats seldom chase dogs.
