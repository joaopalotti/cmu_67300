Salami is a sausage that first came from Italy. The name comes from the Italian salare meaning to make something salty.

The original salami was made from a mix of chopped  pork  and salt which was dried using air in a casing. People who are Muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork. Now there are many types of salamis made in some countries. Nearly all are seasoned with a combination of  herb s and  spice s in addition to salt. Salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying. Some kinds are made of  beef  while others mix beef and pork. Most, if not all Italian salamis have  garlic  in them, but few  Germany German  kinds do, for example. Some, like a few salamis from  Spain , include  paprika  or  Chili pepper chili . The difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped.  Some "light" salami might add  turkey  or  chicken  to reduce both  fat  and  calorie s.

Many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from. Some examples are  Arles ,  Genoa Genoese ,  Hungary Hungarian , and  Milan o salamis.
