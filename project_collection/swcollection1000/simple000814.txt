Peruvian territory was home to the Norte Chico civilization, one of the oldest in the world, and to the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty, which included most of its South American colonies. After achieving independence in 1821.

Peru suffered a terrible  guerrilla warfare  guerrilla war  in the  1980s . The communist (Maoist)  Sendero Luminoso Shining Path  tried to take over the country. But after the leader of the group was captured in  1992 , Shining Path was not a threat anymore. During the  1990s , it was ruled by President  Alberto Fujimori . During this time, the economy of Peru got better, and it became easier to start a company or operate a business.

  History  
Peru was the home of the  Inca Empire . The Incas were a well-organized  India n civilization that began the city of Cuzco (now called  Cusco ). ref name lifepac cite book  title  LIFEPAC, History and Geography last  K. Buskey first  Theresa publisher  Alpha Omega Publications location   isbn  978-1-58095-155-5 pages  34 url   ref  Beginning in the 1400s, they defeated many nearby tribes and built an empire in the Andes. The Inca forced the people to work for the  king  for a certain number of days every year. They used this "work tax" to build roads and terraces on the sides of the mountains to grow crops, and huge cities with rich  palace s for the rulers and their queens. Records were kept on quipa, knotted ropes, since the Incas never invented writing. These could be quickly sent anywhere in the empire by a series of  relay  runners set up along the roads. Heavier loads were sent by  llama s, the pack animals of the Andes. ref name lifepac 
The Incas were rich in  gold  and  silver  which could be found in the mountains. The Spanish wanted that treasure when they discovered the nation in the 1500s. Francisco Pizarro, a Spanish man, kidnapped and killed the Inca ruler in 1532, even after his people paid a huge amount of treasure for his release. The Incas fought the Spanish for many years, but the last Inca king was killed in 1572.
Peru was a Spanish colony until 1821.  Spanish language Spanish  is still the main language of the people, although many also speak Quechua, the Inca language. ref name lifepac
