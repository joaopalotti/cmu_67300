Breakfast sausage

Breakfast sausage  is a type of fresh  pork   sausage  made from  season ed  ground   meat  mixed with  bread  crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

 Using breakfast sausages 
Breakfast sausages are not  curing cured  or  smoking smoked  like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the  refrigerator  or the  Refrigerator freezer . Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot  soap y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually  Frying fried  or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at  breakfast , often with cooked  Egg (food) eggs ,  pancake s, and  toast ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as "toad in the hole" a cooked batter dish.

 Types of breakfast sausages 
Different types made from pork and  beef  mixtures as well as  poultry  can now be found. There are also  vegetarian  types that use  tofu textured vegetable protein  in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.
