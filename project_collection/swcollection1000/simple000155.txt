 Egypt is our topic next year. 

 History 
Egypt has been an independent country since 1922. It is a member of the  United Nations  and the  Arab League . It was a  republic  from 1952 after the  revolution  of 1952 led by  general officer General   Muhammad Naguib , who became the first  President .

 Geography 
Egypt, is a large country, but a large portion of it is  desert . Most people live in areas around the coast of the  Mediterranean Sea  and along the  Nile  River. This includes the cities of  Cairo ,  Alexandria ,  Aswan , and  Port Said . Not many people live in the desert. Today, Egypt has about 90 million people.

Egypt is divided into 29 areas, called  Governorates of Egypt .

 Politics 
Egypt is a country which has had many different rulers and many political systems. Here is a summary of its political history since  World War II . After this war, Egypt was ruled by a king,  Farouk of Egypt  (11 February 1920 - 18 March 1965). He was the last ruler of the  Muhammad Ali Pasha Muhammad Ali   dynasty .

Farouk was overthrown on 23 July 1952 by a military coup. The coup was led by Muhammad Naguib, and  Gamal Abdel Nasser . From then on, Egypt had military rulers or rulers who had the backing of the army and many citizens. 

Nasser became President, from 1956 to 1970. Later rulers were  Anwar Sadat , and  Hosni Mubarak . After Mubarak came a change. In 2012, an attempt was made to have a democratic election for the post of President. The winner was the  Moslem Brotherhood  candidate,  Mohamed Morsi . The events which followed are still controversial, but one aspect stands out. Morsi issued a declaration that in effect gave him unlimited powers. He had the power to legislate (make laws) without any legal overview by the courts. This caused widespread protests. On 3 July 2013 he was unseated by a military coup council (a  coup d'etat ). After an election in June 2014,  Abdel Fattah el-Sisi  became President of Egypt. Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, rejected the change of regime as a military coup, and not democratic. 

Mohamed Morsi is currently under sentence of death, though this may not be carried out.

  Revolution of 2011  
 Main 2011 Egyptian revolution 
In January 2011, thousands of  protest ers gathered in  Cairo . They wanted  Hosni Mubarak  to leave office. He had been the  President  for almost 30 years. On February 11, 2011,  Vice President   Omar Suleiman  made an announcement. He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office. ref name MebarakResignes cite news  title Mubarak Resigns as Egyptian President  first Ahmed A   last Namatalla  coauthors Mariam Fam and Zainab Fattah  newspaper Bloomberg  date 2011-02-11  url http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/mubarak-leaves-presidency-hands-power-to-egypt-s-military-suleiman-says.html   accessdate 2011-02-11  ref
