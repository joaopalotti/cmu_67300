Litre

A  litre  ( liter  in the  United States ) is one of the  metric system metric units  of  volume . It is not an  International System of Units SI unit . 

One litre is the volume of one cubic  metre decimetre , that is a  cube  of 10 x 10 x 10  centimetre centimetres . One litre of  water  has the  mass  of exactly one  kilogram . This results from the definition given in 1795, where the  gram  was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice. ref name decree

The  symbol  for litre is " L " or "l". 

For smaller volumes the  decilitre  is used: 10  deciliter dl  = one litre.

For smaller volumes the  centilitre  is used: 100  centilitre cl  = one litre.

For smaller volumes the  millilitre  is used: 1000  millilitre ml  = one litre.

The capital letter "L" is preferred by some people as the small "l" can look like the number one "1".

Due to public demand, ref name DoWMU  the commission said that the  cubic metre  was too big for everyday use. They said that a new unit based on the old cadil should be used instead. One cadil was to be 0.001 cubic metres. This was equivalent to a  cube  with sides 10 cm. ref cite book

In 1960 the  International System of Units SI  was introduced.  The BIPM changed the definition of the litre back to "one dm sup 3 sup ". The litre is not part of SI. The BIPM defined the litre ref group Note The  hectare are  and the  tonne  were also defined as  "Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI". ref  as a "Non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI". This was because it is used in many  countries. The BIPM said that the litre should not be used very very accurate work. ref cite web

According to SI rules, the symbol for the litre should be "l". This is because the litre was not named after somebody whose name was "Litre". ref group Note For example, the symbol for watts is "W" because watts were named after  James Watt . ref  However the symbol "l" and the number "1" are easily confused. In 1979 the BIPM made an exception for the symbol for the litre. They said that people could use either "L" or "l" as its symbol. ref cite web
