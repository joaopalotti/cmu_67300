A  want  is a  wish  or a  wikt:desire desire  for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to  need , which is when someone  must  have something.

People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can  need  to eat food and can  want  to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer  hungry ) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met.

In  economics , a want is about  Product (consumer goods) goods  or  service economy service s.  Choice  is how to  satisfaction satisfy  a want, when there are different ways to do this.

Want can also be the idea of what it means to be  Poverty poor ,  Starvation hungry  or with no  money .  Charles Dickens  wrote a famous book called  A Christmas Carol  in which there are two children, named Want and  Ignorance .
