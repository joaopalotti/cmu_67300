A  wall  is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of  stone  or  brick . Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from  invasion  and  weather .

Before  artillery  was invented, many  cities  had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most of these walls have been removed.

The term "the Wall" usually referred to the  Berlin Wall , built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the  Pink Floyd  album of the same name.
