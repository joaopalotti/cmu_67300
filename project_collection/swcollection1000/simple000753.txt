 Euro  is the  currency  (money) of the  country countries  in the  eurozone . One euro is divided into 100  cent  (officially) ref http://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/index.en.html European Central Bank website terminology ref  (singular) or "cents" (unofficially). ref cite web url http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/conrep/cr200705en.pdf title European Central Bank, Covergence report May 2007 format PDF quote The euro is the single currency of the  Member States  that have adopted it. To make this singleness apparent, Community law requires a single spelling of the word  euro  in the nominative singular case in all Community and national legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets. accessdate 2008-12-29 ref 

Because of the number of different languages in the European Union, there are different, unofficial, names for this unit (the French call them "centimes" and the Spanish "centimos", for example).

It was created in 1999, but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic payments. In 2002, 12 countries of the  European Union  (EU) got rid of their national currencies completely and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money. There was a change-over period, called the  "transition period" , when both the old national money and the euro were accepted, but by 28 February 2002, all 12 countries were using just euros.

In 2007,  Slovenia  became the 13th country to use the euro . In 2008  Cyprus  and  Malta  became the 14th and 15th countries to use the euro. In 2009,  Slovakia  became the 16th country to use the euro. In 2011,  Estonia  became the 17th country to use the euro. In 2014,  Latvia  became the 18th country and in 2015,  Lithuania  became the 19th country to use the euro.

There are seven different banknotes, each one with a different colour, size and face value: EUR5 (grey), EUR10 (red), EUR20 (blue), EUR50 (orange), EUR100 (green), EUR200 (yellow), EUR500 (purple).

 Coin s are of eight different amounts: EUR0.01, EUR0.02, EUR0.05, EUR0.10, EUR0.20, EUR0.50, EUR1, EUR2.

On every banknote, there is a picture of a different European building style. All banknotes are the same throughout the entire eurozone; there are no different designs for different countries, unlike the euro coins. One side of each coin is the same in all euro countries. The other side is different since each country who mints the coins inserts a symbol relating to that country. Today there are many different sets of coins. Any of the coins can be used everywhere throughout the eurozone despite the country-specific symbol on the back.

The  European Union#Members since 2004 ten new European countries  that entered the  European Union  in May 2004 are planning to adopt the Euro also. First they must meet some conditions to show that they have stable economies.
