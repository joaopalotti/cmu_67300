Mathematics

 Mathematics  is the study of  number s,  shape s and  pattern s. The word is  sometimes shortened to  maths  (in  England ,  Australia , and  New Zealand ) or  math  (in the  United States  and  Canada ).  Mathematician s are people who do mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving  problem s that occur in the real world, so many people besides  mathematician s study and use mathematics. Today, some mathematics is needed in many jobs.  Business ,  science ,  engineering , and  construction  need some knowledge of mathematics.

Mathematicians  wikt:solve solve   problem s by using  logic . Mathematicians often use  Deductive reasoning deduction .  Deduction  is a special way of  wikt:think thinking  to  wikt:discover discover  and prove new  wikt:truth truths  using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking.

  About  
 Mathematics  includes the  Education study  of:
  Numbers (example 3+6=9)
   Structure : how things are  organisation organized .
   wikt:place Place : where things are and their arrangement.
   wikt:change Change : how things become different over time.

Mathematics uses  logic , paper, and calculator. These things are used to create general  rule s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out  information  that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics  solution solves  many  problem s at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems.

A  proof  gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called  axioms . A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a  theorem . Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it. That idea is called a  conjecture  until they find a proof.

Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are  choice chosen  because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us  knowledge understand  the world better.

  Number  
 Mathematics includes the study of  number , or  quantity .

  Name  
The word "mathematics" comes from the  Greek language Greek  word "mathema" (mathema). The Greek word "mathema" means " science ,  knowledge , or  learning ". 

Often, the word "mathematics" is made shorter into  maths  (in  British English ) or  math  (in  American English ). The short words  maths  or  math  are often used for  arithmetic ,  geometry  or simple  algebra  by  student s and their  schools .

  Awards in mathematics  
There is no  Nobel prize  in mathematics. Mathematicians can receive the  Abel prize  and the  Fields Medal  for important works. 

The  Clay Mathematics Institute  has said it will give one million dollars to anyone who solves one of the  Millennium Prize Problems
