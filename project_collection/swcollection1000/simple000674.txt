The  Arctic Ocean  is the  ocean  around the  North Pole . The most northern parts of  Eurasia  and  North America  are around the  Arctic  Ocean. Thick pack  ice  and  snow  cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An  icebreaker  or a nuclear-powered  submarine  can use the  Northwest Passage  through the Arctic Ocean to go between the  Pacific Ocean Pacific  and  Atlantic Ocean Atlantic  oceans.

The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km sup 2 sup , which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has  convert 45389 km mi 0 lk on abbr off  of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about  convert 3 m ft 1 lk on abbr off  thick. The  biology  there is quite special.  Endangered species  there include  walrus es,  whale s and  polar bear s. Year by year the Arctic ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of  global warming .

  Geography  
The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km sup 2 sup .  The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long ref name Arctic Ocean Fast Facts cite web url http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/area/species/polarbear/habitat/ title Arctic Ocean Fast Facts publisher wwf.pandora.org (World Wildlife Foundation) accessdate 2010-10-28  archiveurl   http://web.archive.org/web/20101029234119/http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/arctic/area/species/polarbear/habitat/  archivedate  29 October 2010   deadurl  no ref  It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands.

It is generally taken to include  Baffin Bay ,  Barents Sea ,  Beaufort Sea ,  Chukchi Sea ,  East Siberian Sea , Greenland Sea,  Hudson Bay ,  Hudson Strait ,  Kara Sea ,  Laptev Sea ,  White Sea  and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the  Bering Strait   and to the Atlantic Ocean through the  Greenland Sea  and  Labrador Sea .

Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States.

  Climate  
The Arctic Ocean is contained in a  polar climate . Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies. 

The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater.  Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater.
The temperature must reach -1.8 degC (28.8 degF) before freezing occurs.

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April -- about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).

The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10-20 degC (50-68 degF). The surface waters of the northernmos. Arctic ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms

  Animal and plant life  
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
