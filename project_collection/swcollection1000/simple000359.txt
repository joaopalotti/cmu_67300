  Mathematics  
In mathematics, one is also the only number with this special fact: Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number.
Then, the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any except itself. The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it cannot be divided by any other number to give one as the answer. Let  n  be any number. Then  n /1 =  n  but 1/ n  is never 1 (when n is not 1). Example: 7/1 = 7 but 1/7 is not 1 but 0.142857 ...

Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer.  n / n  = 1 (when n is not 0). Example: 7/7 = 1.

 0.999...  is a  repeating decimal  that is mathematically equal to 1. Many  mathematical proof proofs  have been made to show this is correct.

  Computer science  
The number one is important for  computer science  because it is, together with  zero , a part of the  binary  numeral system. In  machine code  and in many  programming language s, one means true and zero means false.

  Other meanings

  In numerology, the number one is a symbol for everything ( unity ), the beginning, and  God .
