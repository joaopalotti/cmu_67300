  History  
 File:African-civilizations-map-pre-colonial.svg thumb|Civilizations before European colonization. 
The history of Africa begins from the first modern  humans human beings  and leads to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent. 

Africa's ancient historic period includes the rise of  Ancient Egypt Egyptian civilization , the further development of societies outside the Nile River Valley and the interaction between them and civilizations outside of Africa. In the late 7th century North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of  Islam . That led to the appearance of new cultures such as those of the  Swahili people . This also led to an increase in the  slave trade  that had a very bad influence for the development of the whole continent until the 19th century.

  Slavery

  Colonialism  
In the late nineteenth century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many  colony colonial  and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states:  Ethiopia  (known to Europeans as " Abyssinia "), and  Liberia .

 Egypt  and  Sudan  were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt   was effectively under British administration until 1922.

  Modern history  
African independence movements had their first success in 1951 when  Libya  became the first former  colony  to become  independence independent . Modern African history has been full of  revolution s and  war s as well as the growth of modern African economies and  democracy democratization  across the continent.

A civil war in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  (formerly  Zaire ) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, 5,5 million are estimated to have died because of it. ref cite news  url http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8792068/Is-your-mobile-phone-helping-fund-war-in-Congo.html   title Is your mobile phone helping fund war in Congo?  date  27 September 2011  work The Daily Telegraph  location London  first Gordon  last Rayner ref 

Political associations such as the  African Union  offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.

  Climate  
 File:Vegetation Africa.png thumb|200px| Biome s of Africa 
From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:
 Alpine and mediterranean climate
 Dry  sand y  desert 
 Fairly dry  savannah  ( grassland )
 Rain forest 
 More grassland
 More deserts
 Table Mountain 

Running north-east to the south is the  East Africa n  Great Rift Valley . This has mountains,  volcano es, deep  Rift (geology) rifts  and  valley s, rivers and  lakes .

In fact Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types.

  Rainfall  
 File:Rain shadow.svg thumb|200px|The rainshadow concept, but with wind coming from the west. 
 File:Africa FebAug.gif thumb|200px|This picture shows where vegetation is most common in  February  and  August  (before and after the summer) 
Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the  Sahara Desert  and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa there are few  rivers  or other water sources. Underground water sources, such as  spring (water source) springs  are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An  oasis  is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert.

In that part of the world the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the  Himalaya s and the  Tibetan Plateau  blocks the  monsoon  rain and prevents it getting to North Africa. Also, the  Atlas Mountains  near the north coast
of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.

These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.

Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rain falls near the  equator . The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:
   Tropic of Cancer 
   Tropic of Capricorn 

  Plants and animals  
 File:Libyen-oase1.jpg thumb|200px|This oasis, in  Libya , has lots of plants growing around it. 
Africa has a lot of wildlife. ref J.Hofman and S.Colbert 2009.  The ultimate guide to African mammals . Libeal House, New Jersey. ref ref J.Dorst and P.Dandelot 1983.  A field guide to the larger mammals of Africa . Collins, London. ref  There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large  mammal s. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are  antelope ,  buffalo ,  zebra ,  cheetah ,  elephant ,  lion ,  giraffe ,  rhinoceros ,  apes ,  hyaena , and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of  fish  live in African  lake s and  river s. ref N.Myers 1997. The rich diversity of biodiversity issues. (In: Biodiversity II , ed. E.O. Wilson  et al , National Academy Press. ref 

  Politics  
The  African Union  (AU) is an  international organisation  consisting of all of Africa's states except  Morocco . It aims to transform the  African Economic Community , a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the  Assembly of the African Union African Union Government , consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the  Pan African Parliament . A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP, and then gaining majority support in the PAP.

Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include  Uganda , ref http://www.historycentral.com/nationbynation/Uganda/Human.html ref   Sierra Leone , ref http://www.globalissues.org/article/88/sierra-leone ref   Liberia ,  Sudan , ref http://www.thenation.com/article/genocide-darfur ref   Zimbabwe , ref http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jan/04/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum ref  and  Cote d'Ivoire . ref http://allafrica.com/stories/201102241028.html ref 

  People  
People who come from Africa are called Africans. People north of the Sahara are called Maghrebis and people on the south are called Subsaharans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo and Fulani. The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.
