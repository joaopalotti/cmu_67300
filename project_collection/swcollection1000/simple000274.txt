A  link , also  hyperlink  in  computing , is a part of a  chain . A chain is made of many pieces of  metal ; each piece is a link. 

Today, people also use the  word  link in a new way. The  World Wide Web  on the  Internet  is made of many different  Web page s. The  computer   software  that people use to make these pages ( HTML ) lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way. 

The person who makes the web page can tell the computer to show a  word  or a  picture  on the Web page as a  link . This means that when we  click  on the link with our  computer mouse , the  computer  will show us the new page we want to see. Most links are blue, but they can be any color.

The color of the link will change to dark blue when clicked as the web browser recognises it in the browser's cache. Unless the cache is cleared, the link will always stay dark blue.

  Ways of making links  
There are many ways in making a link on a web page. The process is different for different internet software.
