Time Cube

Time Cube  is a  website  created by  Gene Ray . On that website, Dr. Ray explains his "Time Cube" theory, which describes the planet  Earth  as having a  cube cubic   symmetry , and  time  as rotating four "corners". He also says that all of modern  physics  is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be  test ed.

The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is "stupid and evil". Some of the comments are  racism racist , especially against black people and  Judaism Jews . There are also many comments against  homosexuality gay  people. Many people find the site to be difficult to understand. 

Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the  United States , MIT and Georgia Tech. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believes this is proof of a  conspiracy  to keep information about Time Cube hidden.
