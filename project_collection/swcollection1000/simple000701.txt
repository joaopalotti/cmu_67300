 for the town in Alaska North Pole, Alaska 
The  North Pole  is the point that is farthest north on the planet Earth. It is the point on which axis of  Earth  turns. It is in the  Arctic Ocean  and it's cold there because the  Sun  does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The  Arctic Ocean ocean  around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of  ice . 

There is also a  Magnetic North Pole . It is near the physical North Pole. A  compass  points toward the magnetic North Pole.

There is a star, called the North Star or  Polaris (star) Polaris , that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.
