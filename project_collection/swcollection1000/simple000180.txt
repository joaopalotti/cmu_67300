It means "to write and draw about the Earth". The word was first used by a scientist called  Eratosthenes  (276-194 B.C.).

Its features are things like  continent s,  sea s,  river s and  mountain s. Its inhabitants are all the people and  animal s that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like  tide s,  wind s, and  earthquake s.

A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed. ref cite web  title Geography: The Mother of Sciences  url http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf   archiveurl http://web.archive.org/web/20081003084542/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf   archivedate 3rd October 2008 ref 

Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography.  Physical geography  studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the  population  in a country, how a country's  economy  is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography.

Geographers need to know a lot about  map s because maps are very important for understanding geography. Geographers use maps a lot, and often make them. Making maps is called  cartography , and similarly, people who make maps are cartographers.
