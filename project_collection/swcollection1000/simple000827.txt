decadebox 198 

The  1980s  was the decade that started on January 1, 1980 and ended on December 31, 1989.

This  decade  (group of ten years) is sometimes called the "Greed decade" in English speaking countries. Unlike the  1960s  and  1970s , this is when the word  yuppie  was used to describe "young urban professionals" - young  adult s who lived in  city cities  and started to get good  job s. This was also the rise of a more  conservatism conservative  period in these countries -  Ronald Reagan  was  president  for most of this time in the  United States ,  Margaret Thatcher  was the  Prime Minister  of the  United Kingdom , and  Brian Mulroney  was Prime Minister of  Canada .

This decade also saw the  Soviet Union  fight a  war  that seemed endless in  Afghanistan ,  civil war  in  Ethiopia , and the fall of the  Berlin Wall  which started the end of the  Cold War  and of  Communism  in  Eastern Europe .

The "eighties" are also well known for their extreme  fashion s, such as " big hair ",  New Wave ,  punk rock ,  funk , or  preppy preppies .   Rap  music first started to get big in the 80s, and often went with  breakdancing  in what is now called the "old school" days. Many developments were also made in  computer  technology during these years, and  video game s became popular.

In sports,  Italy national football team Italy  and  Argentina national football team Argentina  won the  FIFA World Cup . The  Philadelphia Phillies ,  Los Angeles Dodgers ,  St. Louis Cardinals ,  Baltimore Orioles ,  Detroit Tigers ,  Kansas City Royals ,  New York Mets ,  Minnesota Twins  and  Oakland Athletics  won the  World Series .
