Time horizon

A  time horizon  is a  future  point in  time  when something must be "done" (a " deadline ") or will be "over" (a " time limit ").  Either way, the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached.

Common time  horizon s people use are:
 end of  day , usually meaning the working day;
 the  weekend ;
 end of  month ;
 fiscal quarter ;
 end of  school  term;
 end of  calendar   year  
 and  end of  fiscal year ''.

It is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored, evaluated, marked or paid for.

 Sport s, for example  football (soccer)  and  basketball , often have time limits.  Baseball  and others do not, which sometimes causes problems.
