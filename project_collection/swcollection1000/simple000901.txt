 Chelsea F.C.  is an  England English   Association football football  club that plays in  English Premier League . The club plays in the  English Premier League Premier League , and they play at the  Stamford Bridge (stadium) Stamford Bridge  in  London .

Chelsea's owner is  Russia n  billionaire   Roman Abramovich . Chelsea finished sixth in the  English Premier League Premier League  (highest division) in the 2011-12 season, but won Europe's club championship, the  UEFA Champions League , in the same season. Eden Hazard was their player of the year for 2015 and they also became champions of the Premier League in the same year at the end of the 2014-15 season.

  History  
Chelsea started in 1905 and played the second division of the league. They won their first trophy in 1955, when they became Champions of the First Division. They won the  FA Cup  in 1970, 1997, 2000 and 2007. They won the  EFL Cup League Cup  in 1965, 1998, 2005 and 2007. In 1970s Chelsea failed to maintain their position of the first division, due to the financial difficulties. In 1990s they challenged the title of Premier League. They came close but did not win it until 2005 and 2006.

In 2003 the Russian billionaire,  Roman Abramovich , purchased Chelsea and invested lots of capital to employ new football players. He also employed  Luiz Felipe Scolari , as the manager of the club. Abramovich also employed Peter Kenyon as the chief executive to be responsible for the commercial strategies of the club. This made Chelsea more and more powerful, and they won the  English Premier League Premier League  in consecutive years. A third straight FA Premier League title slipped through Chelsea's fingertips after their failure to defeat Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium meant that Manchester United had won their ninth league title in fifteen tries.

On September 20, 2007, the very successful manager  Jose Mourinho  left the club by "mutual consent". This exit came just days after a shockingly poor performance which saw them barely scrape out a 1-1 draw in a  UEFA Champions League Champions League  tie against Norwegian side  Rosenborg B.K. . Following Mourinho's exit, Chelsea made Director of Football  Avram Grant , the former manager of Israel from  2002  to  2006 , the new manager of the club, until  May   2008 . Grant took over with Chelsea trailing in the  English Premier League Premier League  "title race" behind  Manchester United F.C. Manchester United  and  Arsenal F.C. Arsenal , and managed to keep Chelsea in the hunt for the league until the last game of the season. He got Chelsea into the  UEFA Champions League Champions League Final  for the first time as well as the  Carling Cup Final , but he was sacked at the end of the season, along with assistant  Henk ten Cate . Grant was sacked from the job after he lost in the final in a 5-6  penalty shootout  loss to Manchester United and replaced by  Luiz Felipe Scolari , the then-Portugal coach, in August. However, after a poor run of results Scolari was sacked on  February 9 ,  2009 . Guus Hiddink took over the club until the rest of the season. In early June they played in the FA Cup final against  Everton F.C. Everton , ref http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_4908061,00.html ref  where Chelsea won 2-1, after  Frank Lampard  and  Didier Drogba  scored goals. In that final,  Louis Saha  of Everton scored the fastest goal in FA Cup history, in 25 seconds. A week later, the former  A.C. Milan Milan  manager  Carlo Ancelotti  was named as the new manager of Chelsea.  Antonio Conte  is their current manager.
