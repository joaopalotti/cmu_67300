 File:Matterhornnorth.jpg thumb|left| Matterhorn  in the  Swiss Alps 

The area of Switzerland is 41,285 km2. The confederation is divided into 23 full states called  cantons of Switzerland cantons . All 26 cantons are:  Aargau ,  Appenzell Innerrhoden ,  Appenzell Ausserrhoden ,  Basel-Stadt ,  Basel-Land ,  Bern (canton) Berne ,  Fribourg (canton) Fribourg ,  Geneva (canton) Geneva ,  Glarus (canton) Glarus ,  Graubunden ,   Jura (canton) Jura ,  Lucerne ,  Neuchatel ,  Nidwalden ,  Obwalden ,  Schaffhausen ,  Schwyz ,  Solothurn ,  St. Gallen ,  Thurgau ,  Ticino ,  Canton of Uri Uri ,  Valais ,  Vaud ,  Zug , and  Zurich Canton Zurich .

The  mountain s are very tall in the center and south of Switzerland. About 60% of Switzerland is in the  Alps  area. Only few people live here. The highest mountain is the  Dufour Peak  at 4,634 m.

Many of the mountains have ice all year. This ice is called  glacier s. The rivers  Rhine ,  Rhone , and many other  river s start in the mountains of Switzerland.

There are many  lake s in Switzerland. The biggest lakes are all in the north and west:  Lake Geneva  ( Lac Leman ),  Lake Zurich ,  Lake Neuchatel  and  Lake Constance  ( Bodensee ).

Mountains in the north of Switzerland are fewer and smaller. That is why most Swiss people live in cities and towns in the north. The  Jura mountains  are in the northwest of Switzerland.

  History  
In  1291 , people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the  Eternal Alliance . Together, they could be free from the people of  Habsburg , who were very strong. In  1315  the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Nafels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles.

People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In  1648 , other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the  Peace of Westphalia . More areas came to be part of Switzerland.

In  1798 , France invaded Switzerland.  The ruler of France was  Napoleon .  He changed many laws.  In 1815 Switzerland again became  independent  from France.  Other countries agreed at the  Congress of Vienna  that Switzerland was free and neutral. 

The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short  civil war  in 1848 was replaced in  1999 . Switzerland did not fight in  World War I  or  World War II . Since  2002 , Switzerland is part of the United Nations.  It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality.

  Government  
 File:Bern luftaufnahme.png thumb|200px| Bern (city) Bern  is the Swiss Capital 

Switzerland is a  republic . Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English,  Bundesrat  in German,  Conseil Federal  in French,  Consiglio Federale  in Italian and  Cussegl Federal  in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women.

The seven people are:
   Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf  
   Doris Leuthard 
   Simonetta Sommaruga 
   Didier Burkhalter  (Vicepresident in 2012)
   Johann N. Schneider-Ammann  
   Ueli Maurer  (President in  2013 )
   Alain Berset  

There are two parts of  parliament  in Switzerland. The  Council of States  and the  National Council . Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council.

The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a  referendum . If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the  constitution . This is called an  initiative . The constitution is the basic law of a country. 

  Economy  
Switzerland is not a member of the  European Union , but it is member of the  European Free Trade Agreement  (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a  contract . This contract makes  trade  even easier. They recently made two other contracts.

The  bank s of Switzerland and the insurance companies in Switzerland together produce eleven per cent of the  gross domestic product . Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists.  Davos ,  St. Moritz ,  Pontresina  and  Flims  are in Switzerland. These towns are important both in winter (for skiing) and in summer. Tourists also like the cities of  Lucerne ,  Geneva City Geneva , and  Zurich City Zurich .
