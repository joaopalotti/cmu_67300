The  People's Republic of China  ( PRC ) ( zh s Zhong Hua Ren Min Gong He Guo  t Zhong Hua Ren Min Gong He Guo  ) is a  one-party state  in  East Asia  governed by the  Communist Party of China . It was founded on 1 October 1949. It has more than 1.3 billion  people , which is more than any other country in the  world . ref name Census2010  It covers an area of 9.6 million  square kilometers . 

The capital city is  Beijing , and  Shanghai  is the city with the most people living in it. Along with the cities of  Tianjin  and  Chongqing , these four cities are " municipality municipalities " directly controlled by the national government. Two other cities are given the status of " special administrative region ". They are  Hong Kong , which was once a colony of the  United Kingdom  and given back to China in 1997; and  Macau , which  Portugal  gave back in 1999. These two cities remain highly  Autonomy autonomous , or have much of their own power. Aside from the "municipalities" and the "SAR's", there are 23  Province provinces  and five " Autonomous region of the PRC autonomous regions ", or regions with more law-making rights than the provinces and with a large number of people of a  minority group  population. They are the  Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region , the  Tibet Autonomous Region  or Xizang Autonomous Region, the  Guangxi Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region , the  Inner Mongolia Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region  or Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, and the  Ningxia Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region .

The central government is responsible for defense and  Foreign policy foreign affairs  but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims  Taiwan  as one of its many provinces.  However, PRC does not have control of  Taiwan  which has an entirely different  political  system and officially known as the  Republic of China Republic of China (Taiwan) .

Home of   Confucianism  and  Daoism , it had great influence on nearby countries including  Japan ,  Korea , and  Vietnam  in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, and even writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of  jade , are some classic examples.

Before the  Qin Dynasty  united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the  Warring States Period . Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many of the great  Eastern philosophy philosophies of the East  were born, including  Confucianism  and  Daoism . Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.

Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern  nomadic people  such as the  Turkic peoples Turkic tribes  and the  Mongol Mongols  lead by  Genghis Khan  and  Kublai Khan . During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the  Qing Dynasty Qin ,  Tang Dynasty Tang ,  Yuan Dynasty Yuan  (Mongolian), and  Qing Dynasty Qing  ( Manchu ). Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.

  A new age  
While China achieved many things in the  First millennium  and early  2nd millennium , it became an  Isolationism isolationist  country in the  15th century 15th century C.E.  This was because Spain found a lot of silver in the newly explored  Continent continents  of  Americas North and South America . Silver was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.

By the time of the  Renaissance , European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over by Europeans, many  Europe European   countries , such as  Britain  and  France  built  spheres of influence  in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few  centuries , by the  Qing Dynasty , it had fallen behind other countries in  technology , and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the  Opium Wars  to  Britain  in the  19th century .

In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the  Sun Yat-sen  and the  Kuomintang , a  nationalist  party, and the  Republic of China  established. Over time,  Marxism Marxist  ideas grew popular and the  Communist Party of China Communist party  was formed.

The  Chinese Civil War  later started between the  Kuomintang  (Nationalists) of the  Republic of China  (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the  Soviet Union , whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by  Mao Zedong ,  Liu Shaoqi  and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

In 1927, the  Chinese Civil War  began as the Kuomintang, led by  Chiang Kai-shek , and the Communists fought one another. By 1949, the  Red Army  of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over  mainland China  and  Mao Zedong  announced the creation of the People's Republic of China.  Chiang Kai-shek  and the other nationalists fled to  Taiwan . File:China, Mao (2).jpg thumb|left| Mao Zedong  founding the People's Republic of China in 1949 

As the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The  Great Leap Forward , from 1958 to 1961, tried to  industrialization industrialize  China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest  famine s in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project. ref name Akbar2010 Cite news url  http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html   title  Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' accessdate 26 March 2013  work The Independent  location London  first Arifa last Akbar date 17 September 2010 ref  In 1966, Mao began the  Cultural Revolution  to remove  capitalism capitalist  influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being "revisionists" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or "counter-revolutionaries" and were  persecution persecuted . Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976.

During this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the  capitalist  countries of the  Western world . Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the  Soviet Union  also became increasingly unfriendly in the  Sino-Soviet Split . In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Mao and  Zhou Enlai  met with US President  Richard Nixon  in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world.

After Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the  Gang of Four  and  Hua Guofeng , the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually,  Deng Xiaoping , one of the  veteran s of the revolution, took power. He began a "Reform and Opening Up" ( zh s Gai Ge Kai Fang  t Gai Ge Kai Fang  ) campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a  market economy market system . Deng's policies would be known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics."

Although Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the  one-child policy , which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the  overpopulation  problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly  controversy controversial  and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also  censorship censored  by the government.

In 1989, the Chinese government used soldiers and tanks to stop a  Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square  organized by students seeking political reform. This action received worldwide criticism and led to  economic sanction s being placed on the Chinese government.

In  August  2008, China hosted the  Summer Olympics  for the first time.

China has many traditional  Festival festivals , such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is  Chinese New Year . People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

 Festivals 
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year. It lasts fifteen days. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. On the first day of the Spring Festival, people call on friends and relatives. Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:Cai Shen Ye ), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:Jiao Zi ). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:Tang Yuan ,Yuan Xiao ), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the  Warring States  period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.
