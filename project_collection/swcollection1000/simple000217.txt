 Helium  is a  chemical element . It has the  chemical symbol   He ,  atomic number  2 and atomic weight of about 4.002602. There are 9 isotopes of helium, only two of which are stable. These are  sup 3 sup He and  sup 4 sup He.  sup 4 sup He is by far the most common isotope.

Helium is called a  noble gas , because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new  Chemical compound compounds . It has the lowest  boiling point  of all the elements. It is the second most common element in the  universe , after  hydrogen , and has no color or smell. However, Helium has a blue-ish, neon color when being burnt with fire. Helium does not usually  Chemical reaction react  with anything else. Astronomers discovered helium in  1868 . They found that it was in the  Sun  before it was found on  Earth . Because of where it was found, its name comes from the  Greek language Greek  word for Sun,  helios .

Helium is used to fill  balloon s and  airship s because it is  density lighter  than  air , and does not burn or react, meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way. It is also used in some kinds of  light  bulbs. People also breathe it in to make their  voice s sound higher than they normally do as a  joke , but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much, since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air. Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to  vocal cords .

It can be created through the process of  nuclear fusion  in the  Sunderland A.F.C. sun  we are currently trying to harness nuclear fusion as a form of power but this is still at an early stage because the sun can  Quantum tunneling quantum tunnel  enough because of its huge size). During this process, four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom.
