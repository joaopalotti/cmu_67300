 Wales  ( IPAc-en ' w eI l z audio   en-us-Wales.ogg ;  lang-cy Cymru ) is a  country   nowiki on the  island  of  Great Britain , and is one of  Countries of the United Kingdom the four countries  that make up the  United Kingdom . It is to the  west   nowiki of  England , and east of the  Irish Sea   nowiki and  Ireland .

Wales is one of the six  Celt ic  nowiki nations, and the native people of Wales, called  Welsh people the Welsh , have their own  culture  and  tradition s. They have their own  Celtic language , which is called  Welsh language Welsh . Although not all Welsh people can speak Welsh (nearly all Welsh people can speak  English language English  and some of them speak only English), it is becoming more popular because all children going to school in Wales have to learn the language.

Just under three  million  people live in Wales, most of who live in the southern and eastern parts of the country. In this area is the  capital city capital  and largest  city  of Wales,  Cardiff , and the next largest city,  Swansea .

  History  
People have lived in Wales for at least 29,000 years. The Romans first entered Wales in 43 AD, and took it around 77 AD.

  The word 'Wales'  
The English words  Wales  and  Welsh  come from the old Germanic word  Walh  (plural:  Walha ).  Walh  itself came from a Celtic tribe, called the  Volcae  by the  Ancient Rome Romans . That was eventually used for the name of all Celts and later to all people who lived in the  Roman empire . The  Anglo-Saxons  who lived in  England  and who spoke  Old English  called the people living in Wales  Waelisc  and the land itself  Wealas . ref name Wales Hist 71 Davies (1994) p. 71 ref  Other names that come from these origins  Wallonia ,  Wallachia , and Vlachs. ref (French) Albert Henry,  UK Histoire des mots Wallons et Wallonie , Institut Jules Destree, Coll. <<Notre histoire>>, Mont-sur-Marchienne, 1990, 3rd ed.

  Conquest by Edward I and brief independence under Owain Glyndwr  
After Llywelyn ap Gruffudd died in 1282, Edward I of England finished his conquest of Wales, which made it a part of England. Owain Glyndwr was a Welsh fighter who managed to fight back and restored independence to Wales, in the early 15th century. However, this didn't last for a long time, and after he was defeated by the English, the whole of Wales was taken over by England, with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542.

  Laws in Wales Acts and annexation by England  
In the 16th century, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 were passed in England while Henry VIII was king there. These added Wales to England. They also said that people who spoke Welsh instead of English could not hold public of gutt.

  Industrial Revolution  
At the start of the Industrial Revolution, the mining and metal industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial country. The new jobs created from the coalfields in South Wales caused a quick rise in the number of people living in Wales. This is the reason why two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, mainly in the capital Cardiff ( Caerdydd ), as well as Swansea ( Abertawe ), Newport ( Casnewydd ), and in the nearby valleys. Now that the coal industry has become a lot smaller, Wales' economy depends mostly on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. In 2010, the Gross Value Added of Wales was PS45.5 billion - PS15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain.

  Return of Welsh identity and devolution of Government  
It took until the 19th Century for Welsh-centric politics to return to Wales.  Liberalism  in Wales, which was introduced in the early 20th century by Lloyd George, was overtaken by the growth of socialism and the  Labour Party . However, Welsh pride got stronger, and in 1925  Plaid Cymru  was made, which was the first political party to campaign for Welsh independence. In 1962, the Welsh Language Society was made to encourage the  Welsh language , which had nearly disappeared during the take over by England. A big change was made in 1998, when the first Government of Wales for the country since its addition to the United Kingdom under the Government of Wales Act (1998). This created an Assembly for Wales, known in Welsh as the senedd. The Senedd has responsibility for a range of laws which have been  Devolved power devolved  from the main  UK  government in  Westminster . This means the members of the Assembly can change certain laws in Wales to be different to the rest of the UK.

  Geography  
Wales has a coastline which is 1680 miles long, and the country itself is 20,779 km sup 2  sup large. The highest mountains in Wales are in  Gwynedd , in the north-west, and include  Snowdon  ( lang cy Yr Wyddfa ), which is the highest peak in Wales at 1085 m (3,560 ft). There are three National Parks in Wales:  Snowdonia  ( lang-cy Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri ), Brecon Beacons ( lang-cy Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog ), and  Pembrokeshire  Coast ( lang-cy Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro ).

  Politics  
 Local government 
Wales is divided into 22 council areas. These areas are responsible for local government services, such as education, social work, environment and roads services. ref cite web url http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en   title Local Authorities  publisher Welsh Assembly Government   accessdate 9 September 2010 ref

  Welsh identity  
Welsh people are very proud of their country. The first people in Wales to call themselves 'Welsh' were the Celts. The Celts lived in Wales after the Romans left in the 5th century. The national emblems of Wales are  leek s and  daffodil s. 

Although Wales is very close to the rest of Great Britain, and despite most people speaking  English language English , the country has always had a distinct  culture . It is officially  bilingual  in English and Welsh. Over 560,000 people in Wales speak the  Welsh language . In some parts of the north and west of the country, particularly in small, rural communities, the majority of people speak  Welsh language Welsh .

From the late 19th century, Wales became famous as the "land of song", and for its  Eisteddfod  culture festival. At many international sport events, for example the  FIFA World Cup , the  Rugby World Cup , and the  Commonwealth Games , Wales competes on its own, as a separate country. However, at most international events, such at the  Olympics , Wales competes with the rest of the Great Britain, and sometimes as the  United Kingdom  with  Northern Ireland  included.  Rugby Union  is strongly associated with Wales as a national sport.
