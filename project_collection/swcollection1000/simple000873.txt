The  Creative Commons  is a  non-profit  organisation that tries to make creative work available for others to use and share.

  Aim  
Their website allows  copyright  holders to give some of their rights to any other people. They still keep some other rights. They do this through  license s and  contract s. Some of these make the work  public domain  or  open content . They do this because  copyright law  can stop people sharing information.

The project has different free licenses. A person who has copyright can choose which one they want to use when they publish their work. They also provide  Resource Description Framework RDF / XML   metadata . These say what the licenses are and make it easier to automatically sort out and find work that has these licenses. They also provide a 'Founder's Copyright' contract. ref http://creativecommons.org/%20projects/founderscopyright Founders' Copyright - Creative Commons ref  This aims to give the same effects as the original  United States US  Copyright did.

  History  
Creative Commons was officially started in  2001 .

 Lawrence Lessig  is the founder and chairman of Creative Commons. Lessig started it as a way of reaching the goals of his Supreme Court case,  Eldred v. Ashcroft .

  Localisation
