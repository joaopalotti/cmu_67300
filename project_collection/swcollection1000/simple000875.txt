Animals normally have 2 or 4 legs ( vertebrate s, which are animals with a  backbone ), or 6, 8, or 12 ( arthropod s, for example  insect s and  spider s).  Centipede s and  millipede s have a lot more legs, but not exactly a hundred or a thousand as their names make people who do not know them think.  Human s have 2 legs, complete with  feet .

 Biped  is an animal with two legs and  quadruped  is an animal with four legs.

People also use the word "leg" in  idiom s, for example: 
 you do not have a leg to stand on  (that means "you have no support; you have no chance in this discussion") 
 to leg it  (to run)
 to pull someone's leg  (to play a little joke on someone for fun by trying to make them believe something that is not true)
