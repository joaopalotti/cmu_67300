Neptune was discovered by the  astronomer s,  Urbain Le Verrier  and  John Couch Adams . They were both  honor ed for the discovery. The planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a  telescope . Because of  Uranus ' odd movements in its orbit (the line which a planet follows in moving), it made astronomers search for the new planet. The planet was visited by only one spacecraft,  Voyager 2  on August 25, 1989. Neptune once had a huge storm known as the "Great Dark Spot" which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2. However, the dark spot was not seen in 1994, and new spots were found since then. It is not known why the dark spot disappeared.  Visits by more  space probe s have been proposed.

  History  
  Discovery

Because of Neptune's slow movement across the sky, Galileo's small telescope was not strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet. ref name Neptune cite web  publisher Crystal Links  title Neptune  url http://www.crystalinks.com/neptune.html   accessdate 2007-6-10 ref 

In 1821,  Alexis Bouvard  published the astronomical tables of the  orbit  of  Uranus . ref A. Bouvard (1821),  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1821tapp.book.....B&db_key=AST&data_type=HTML&format=&high=44b52c369020669 Tables astronomiques publiees par le Bureau des Longitudes de France ,kikin, FR: Bachelier ref  Later observations showed that Uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit, making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of Uranus. In 1843,  John Couch Adams  calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus. He sent his calculations to Sir  George Airy , the  Astronomer Royal , who asked Adams for an explanation. Adams began to make a copy of the reply, but never sent it.

In 1846,  Urbain Le Verrier , who was not working with Adams, made his own calculations but also failed to get much attention from French astronomers. However, in the same year,  John Herschel  began to support the mathematical method and encouraged  James Challis  to search for the planet.  After much delay, Challis began his unwilling search in July 1846.  Meanwhile,  Urbain Le Verrier Le Verrier  had convinced  Johann Gottfried Galle  to search for the planet.

Although  Heinrich d'Arrest  was still a student at the  Berlin Observatory , he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier's predicted area, could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a  planet , as compared to a fixed star. Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23, 1846, within 1deg of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 10deg from Adams' prediction. Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August, failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work.

After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread, there was also a lot of arguing between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery. Later, an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit. However, historians are now reviewing  the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the "Neptune papers" (historical documents from the  Royal Greenwich Observatory ), which had seemingly been stolen by astronomer  Olin Eggen  for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered (in his ownership) right after his death. ref name Neptdisc cite web url http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/nk/neptune/index.htm   title Neptune's Discovery.

  Naming  
Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was temporarily called "the planet exterior to Uranus" or "Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle. He proposed the name  Janus . In England, Challis suggested the name  Oceanus . In France,  Francois Jean Dominique Arago Arago  suggested that the new planet be called  Leverrier , a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside  France . French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name  Herschel  for  Uranus  and  Leverrier  for the new planet.

Meanwhile, on separate and different reason, Adams suggested changing the name  Georgian  to  Uranus , while Leverrier (through the Board of Longitude) suggested  Neptune  for the new planet.  Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve Struve  gave support of that name on December 29, 1846, to the  Saint Petersburg  Academy of Sciences. ref cite journal  url http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AN.../0025//0000164.000.html   title Second report of proceedings in the Cambridge Observatory relating to the new Planet (Neptune)  year 1847  journal Astronomische Nachrichten  volume 25  pages 309  last Hind  first J.

  Structure  
  Mass and composition  
At 10.243 e 25 kilogram kg , Neptune's mass puts the planet between  Earth  and the largest gas giants; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1/18th the mass of  Jupiter . Neptune and  Uranus  are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as " ice giants ", given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to  Jupiter  and  Saturn (planet) Saturn . In the search for  extrasolar planets , Neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet. Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called "Neptunes". ref cite news  url http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1965.html   title Trio of Neptunes  publisher Astrobiology Magazine  date  May 21, 2006  accessdate 2007-8-6 ref  just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar "Jupiters."

The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen, with a smaller amount of helium. A tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere. Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue. ref cite web

Because Neptune orbits so far from the  Sun , it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at -218 degC (55 K). Deeper inside the layers of gas, however, the temperature rises slowly. Like Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the differences are larger: Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System. Several possible explanations have been suggested, including  radiogenic  heating from the planet's core, the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by  Accretion theory infalling matter  during the planet's birth, and  gravity wave s breaking above the  tropopause . ref

The structure of the inside of Neptune is thought to be very similar to the structure of the inside of Uranus. There is likely to be a  planetary core core , thought to be about 15 Earth masses, made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock, water, ammonia, and methane. The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids, in spite of the large temperatures near the core. The atmosphere, extending about 10 to 20% of the way towards the center, is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes. More mixtures of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere. Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior. The pressure at the center of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of  Earth . Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of  oblateness  shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike Uranus.

  Weather and magnetic field  
One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of  broken wikt link meteorology meteorological  activity that has been observed (seen or measured). When the Voyager spacecraft flew by  Uranus  in 1986, that winds on that planet were observed to be mild. When Voyager flew by Neptune in 1989, powerful weather events were observed. The weather of Neptune has extremely active storm systems. Its  atmosphere  has the highest wind speeds in the solar system, thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat. Regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around 1,200 km/h (750 mph), while winds in storm systems can reach up to 2,100 km/h, near- supersonic  speeds. ref name Hammel1989 cite journal

In 1989, the  Great Dark Spot , a  tropical cyclone cyclonic storm  system the size of  Eurasia , was discovered by  NASA 's  Voyager 2  spacecraft. The storm resembled the  Great Red Spot  of  Jupiter (planet) Jupiter . However, on November 2, 1994, the  Hubble Space Telescope  did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere. The reason why the Great Dark Spot has disappeared is unknown. One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet's core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns. The  Scooter  is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the  Voyager  encounter in 1989: it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter. The  Wizard's eye / Dark Spot 2  is another southern cyclonic storm, the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter. It originally was completely dark, but as  Voyager  came closer to the planet, a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images.

Unlike other gas giants, Neptune's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below. Though Neptune's atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus, both planets are made up of the same gases and ices. Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn, but are rather ice giants, meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices. Neptune is very cold, with temperatures as low as -224 degC (-372 degF or 49 K) recorded at the cloud tops in 1989.

Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its  magnetosphere , with a  magnetic field  strongly tilted comparative to its  rotation al axis at 47deg and offset at least 0.55 radii (about 13,500 kilometres) from the planet's physical center. Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus' sideways rotational movement.

  Neptune's Rings  
 mainarticle Rings of Neptune 
 File:Neptune rings PIA02224.jpg thumb|right|150px|Neptune's Rings 

Very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet, but they are not as well known as the rings of  Saturn (planet) Saturn . When these rings were discovered by a team led by  Edward Guinan , originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings. However, this was proven wrong by  Voyager 2 . Neptune's  planetary ring s have a weird "clumpy" arrangement. Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them. Citation needed date January 2012 

Proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid-1980s, when  occultation stellar occultation  were found to rarely show an extra "blink" just before or after the planet occulted the star. Pictures from  Voyager 2  in 1989 solved the problem, when the ring system was found to have several faint rings. The farthest ring, Adams, has three famous arcs now named  Liberte ,  Egalite , and  Fraternite  (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity).

The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time. The gravitational effects of  Galatea (moon) Galatea , a moon just inward from the ring, are now thought to have created the arcs.

Several other rings were discovered by the  Voyager  cameras. Also with the thin  John Couch Adams Adams  Ring about 63,000 km from the center of Neptune, the  Urbain Le Verrier Leverrier  Ring is at 53,000 km and the wider, smaller  Johann Gottfried Galle Galle  Ring is at 42,000 km. A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named  William Lassell Lassell ; it is surrounded at its outer edge by the  Francois Arago Arago  Ring at 57,000 km. ref http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append8.html Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature Ring and Ring Gap Nomenclature (December 8, 2004) .  USGS - Astrogeology Research Program . ref 

New Earth-based observations published in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are a lot more unstable than thought before. To be exact, it looks like that the  Liberte  ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than 100 years. The new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of Neptune's rings into a lot of confusion. ref cite web  url http://www.newscientist.com/channel/space/mg18524925.900   title Neptune's rings are fading away  date March 26, 2005  publisher New Scientist  accessdate  2007-8-6  ref

It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a  synchronous orbit , and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the  Roche limit . Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system, with temperatures of -235 degC (38 K, -392 degF). Its diamter is 2700 km, (80% of Earth's Moon, Luna), its mass is 2.15x1022 kg (30% of Luna), its orbital diameter is 354,800 km (90% of Luna) and its orbital period is 5.877 days (20% of Luna).

Neptune's second known moon (by order of distance), the odd moon  Nereid (moon) Nereid , has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the  solar system .

From July to September 1989,  Voyager 2  discovered six new moons of Neptune. Of these, the lumpy-shaped  Proteus (moon) Proteus  is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity. Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon, it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton. Neptune's closest four moons,  Naiad (moon) Naiad ,  Thalassa (moon) Thalassa ,  Despina (moon) Despina , and  Galatea (moon) Galatea , orbit close enough to be inside Neptune's rings.

The next farthest out,  Larissa (moon) Larissa  was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. The moon was credited for causing Neptune's ring arcs when  Voyager 2  observed Neptune in 1989. Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. ref cite journal  author Holman, Matthew J.  et al.   date August 19, 2004  url http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n7002/abs/nature02832.html   title Discovery of five irregular moons of Neptune  journal Nature  volume 430  pages 865-867 ref ref cite news  url http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3578210.stm   title Five new moons for planet Neptune  date August 18, 2004  publisher BBC News  accessdate August 6, 2007 ref  The latest moon was discovered from examining Hubble Telescope imags on July 16, 2013.

  Observation  
Neptune cannot be seen with  naked eye  alone, since Neptune's normal brightness are between  Apparent magnitude magnitudes  +7.7 and +8.0, ref name Neptune  which can be out-shined by  Jupiter (planet) Jupiter 's Galilean moons, the  dwarf planet   Ceres (dwarf planet) Ceres , and the  asteroid s  4 Vesta ,  2 Pallas ,  7 Iris ,  3 Juno  and  6 Hebe . A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot, similar in appearance to Uranus. The blue color comes from the  methane  in its atmosphere. ref cite book   title The Data Book of Astronomy   author Moore, Patrick  year 2000  pages 207 ref  Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually; most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the  Hubble Space Telescope  and large ground-based telescopes with  adaptive optics .

With an  orbital period  ( sidereal period ) of 164.88 Julian calendar Julian years , Neptune will soon return (for discovery) to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in 1846. This will happen three different times, also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position. These are April 11, 2009, when it will be in  Prograde and retrograde motion prograde motion ; July 17, 2009, when it will be in  Prograde and retrograde motion retrograde motion ; and February 7, 2010, when it will be in prograde motion. It will also come very close to being at the same point since the 1846 discovery in late October through early-mid November 2010, when Neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of Neptune's discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within 2 arc minutes at that point (closest on November 7, 2010). This will be the last time for about the next 165 years that Neptune will be at its point of discovery.

This is explained by the idea of  retrogradation . Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth, Neptune goes through  retrogradation  at certain points during its  Orbital period synodic period . In addition to the start of retrogradation, other events inside the synodic period include  astronomical opposition , the return to  prograde and retrograde motion prograde motion , and  Conjunction (astronomy) conjunction  to the Sun.

In its orbit around the Sun, Neptune returned to its original point of discovery in August 2011. ref name Neptune 

  Exploration

 File:Voyager.jpg 200px|thumb|right| Voyager 2 . 

Currently, only one spacecraft has visited Neptune.  NASA 's  Voyager 2  probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25, 1989, and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft.

Some of  Voyager 2 "s important discoveries was its very close fly-by of  Triton (moon) Triton  where took pictures of several parts of the moon. The probe also discovered the  Great Dark Spot , although it has now disappeared after when the  Hubble Space Telescope  took pictures of Neptune in 1994. Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system, it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck.

Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system's gas giants. In the outer regions of the solar system, where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth (still very bright with a magnitude of -21), the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected. One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around. The winds on  Jupiter  were already hundreds of kilometres per hour. Rather than seeing slower winds, the scientists found faster winds (over 1600 km/h) on more distant Neptune.

One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced,  turbulence  is created, which slows the winds down (like those of Jupiter). At Neptune however, there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance, and are able to keep very high speeds. Anyhow, Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun, ref name Beebe1992 cite journal
