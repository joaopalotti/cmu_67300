Multiverse

Cosmology 
A  multiverse  (or meta-universe) is the  theory  of a  set  of multiple possible  universe s, including our  universe , which make up  reality . These universes are sometimes called  parallel universe s . A number of different versions have been considered. They all have the same weakness: there is no known way these ideas can be tested.

You can think of universes as "bubbles". When two of these "bubbles" collide they may have caused the big bang. They can also separate to form two smaller universes.

The term "multiverse" was  wikt:coin#verb coined  by psychologist  William James . ref James, William 1895.  The Will to Believe , and earlier in 1895, as cited in  OED 's new 2003 entry for "multiverse": 1895 W. JAMES in  International Journal of Ethics   6  p10. "Visible nature is all plasticity and indifference, a multiverse, as one might call it, and not a universe". ref
