  History  
 Further Ancient Greece 
 File:Parthenon.JPG thumb|left|The  Parthenon  in  Athens . 
 Ancient Greece Greece's history  is one of the richest in the world. The Greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations. Greece is famous for its many  philosophers , like  Plato  and  Aristotle , and kings like  Alexander the Great  and  Leonidas . Greece is said to be the  birthplace of  Democracy , because city-states like  Athens , now the capital of Greece, were the first to elect their leaders and not have  king s. During the years of  Alexander the Great , a huge Greek empire was created that stretched from modern-day Greece to  Egypt  and  Iran , until the borders of  India . Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time, it is called the  Hellenistic  period (or  Greek-dominated period ). During that time, the  Greek language  became the ' lingua franca ' of the  Middle East , which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate, like  English language English  is used today as an international language.

Greece was then ruled by the  Roman Empire , and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army, but Greece conquered Rome with its culture. The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco-Roman (or Greek-Roman) civilization.  When the Roman Empire collapsed, the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the  Byzantine Empire , and the  Greek language  became the official language of the empire, which included all the eastern  Mediterranean Sea ,  Turkey ,  Egypt  and other countries in the area.  It was then occupied by the  Ottoman Empire  for a period of 400 years. Some areas of Greece, like the second-largest city in the country,  Thessaloniki , were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece less than 100 years ago. 
 image:Greekhistory.GIF thumb|left|Greece was bigger in 1920 that it is today. 
The  Greek War of Independence  began on the 25th of March 1821, according to tradition, and Greece was an independent country (a republic) in 1828. In reality, the Greek War of Independence began on 23 February 1821, when  Alexander Ypsilantis ref name test Alexander Ypsilantis, Renamed from greek is based on ISO 843 standard. ref (Greek Alexandros Upselantes) declared the start of the revolution in modern-day  Romania . In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the  United Kingdom  and  Russia , under the  Germany German  Wittelsbach dynasty. Greece fought in both  World War I  and  World War II  in the side of allies. In 1912, Greece took part in the  Balkan Wars , where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now, such as  Greek Macedonia  and the islands of the  Aegean Sea . In 1920 Greece expanded again, and reached its maximum size, but the territories that the country had gained in  Turkey  were given back to Turkey in 1923, but Greece kept  Western Thrace .

In 1940, Greece was invaded by  Italy , but managed to defeat the Italian invasion and marked the first victory of an Allied country against an  Axis countries Axis power  (the side of  Hitler ). After the defeat of  Italy ,  Hitler  decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned. Germany invaded on  6 April   1940  and captured Greece's second-largest city of  Thessaloniki  on 9 April, while Athens was captured on 27 April. Greece suffered major damages in the  Second World War  and was involved in a  civil war  between 1946 and 1949, which left the country devastated and the people very poor. The Greek civil war was fought between the  communists  and the people who supported the  king , who also had support from the  United Kingdom  and the  United States .

In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy. Free elections were then held again 7 years later, and the Greeks voted to send the  king  away and declared a  republic  in 1974. Greece became a member of the  European Union  in 1981. Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s, but some of the country's economic statistics were modified to appear more correct than they were, as the government had lied with the help of banks from the  United States . In 2004, Greece hosted the  Olympic Games  for a second time. Since 2009, Greece has been in an economic crisis, which is also becoming a political crisis.

  Politics  
 image:Hellenic Parliament-MPs swearing in.png thumb|left|The Greek  parliament  is in  Athens . 
Greece is not a federal state like the  United States , but a unitary state like the  United Kingdom .  It  is ruled by a  parliament , called the  Hellenic Parliament  (or  Greek Parliament  in Simple English), which has 300 members. It is a parliamentary republic, which means that, unlike in the  United States , the  President  has very few powers. The person in charge of the government of Greece is the  Prime Minister . 

Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation. It officially became the  Third Hellenic Republic  (or  Third Republic of Greece  in Simple English) in 1975, when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote.

Greece was under a  military dictatorship  between 1967 and 1975, which collapsed after the  invasion of Cyprus , and handed over power to  Constantine Karamanlis . Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973, but were suppressed by the regime, which sent a  tank  to crash the gates of the Athens Polytechnic and forcefully stop the protests. Greece was also under a  fascism fascist   dictatorship  from 1936 until 1941, when it was invaded by  Nazi Germany . During  World War I , Greece was divided into two countries, the  State of Thessaloniki  in the north and the  State of Athens  in the south. Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece, but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies. The country was reunited in 1917, when the King abdicated. 

There are many political parties in Greece, but only seven are in the Greek parliament. Until 2015, only two political parties formed governments, the PASOK party (which is  social democrat ic) and New Democracy (which is  conservatism conservative ). The government ousted in the 2015 election was led by PASOK, DIMAR AND ND. Other parties include the  Communist  party, the left-wing  SYRIZA  party, the  nationalist  party and others.  SYRIZA , led by  Alexis Tsipras , won the  2015   parliament ary election held on  January 25  of that year, and entered into a coalition government with the small right-wing party  Greek Independents .

The Greek government recognizes only one minority in the country, the  Turkey Turkish  one in the region of  Thrace . The dispute between Greece and the  Republic of Macedonia  has resulted in the refusal of Greece to acknowledge the existence of a Macedonian minority.

 Greek flag 
 Main Flag of Greece 
 image:Greek flag waving.png thumb|The Greek flag is blue and white. 
The  Flag of Greece Greek flag  was officially adopted in 1828 as a civil and state ensign (a flag for use only on boats and ships) and as a national flag when flown outside of Greece, for example on embassies. A different flag (white cross on a blue field) was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978. In 1978 the current flag became  national flag  and the older land flag was abolished. 

There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag. One says that the blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves, and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breakaway from tyranny and blue for Greece. There are nine stripes on the flag, which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase "Eleutheria e Thanatos'' which means "freedom or death.'' The cross stands for Christianity.

  Economy  
 image:Euro banknotes.png thumb|left|The  money  used in Greece is called the  euro . 
Greece is a  capitalist capitalist country , like the  United States  and  France . Greece has the largest number of trading ships (a 'merchant navy') in the world. Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece. In the 20th century Greece had its own currency but now uses the  Euro  as most other European Community countries do.  

Greece has adopted some  welfare state  policies, such as public healthcare and free education, like many other  Europe an countries. Greece, however, has not collected enough taxes to pay for them. The  pension  system is especially expensive. Thousands of Greeks are retired before the age of 55.  Political leaders have decreased the retirement age several times. Currently the average age of retirement is 50 for women and 55 for men. 

This is putting Greece in a very difficult situation when the country has accumulated a debt of about EUR350 billion, or debt by 170 per-cent of the country's total GDP. ref http://www.gp.se/nyheter/varlden/1.767321-samtal-om-grekisk-koalitionsregering ref ref http://prevarication.net/2010/05/greek-collapse-spurs-selloff-greek-retirement-age-as-early-as-50/ ref   Greece also has a trade deficit, meaning that it buys more things than it sells.  The country is cutting costs and asking for loans in order to avoid bankruptcy.

 Tourism 
About 16.5 million tourists visit Greece each year. ref name CIA  That is more than the country's entire population. ref name CIA  Since there are so many tourist in Greece, it has many international airports.
