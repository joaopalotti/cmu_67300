  History  

The Pope used to rule the Papal States, which included most of Italy. Catholic popes had generally tried to stop Italy from becoming one country because they feared they would lose their control of at least one of the Papal States. cn  In 1861 Italy was unified under the King of Savoy, but  Rome  and  Latium  remained unconquered. On September 20, 1870 Italian troops invaded. Rome became capital of the new kingdom.

The  Pope  claimed he was a prisoner of the Italian state and  excommunication excommunicated  all the people who helped invade the Papal state. This stopped Catholics from taking part in public life under Catholic government.

In 1929  Benito Mussolini , decided to sign an agreement with the Holy See, called the  Lateran Treaty , which created the Vatican State. Another treaty gave the Vatican money each year to compensate for the lost territories.

  Politics and Government  
The government  Hierarchy structure  is a theocracy with the  Pope Pontifical leader  being the highest authority. A bishop is elected by the College of Cardinals to become the new Pope and leader of the Holy See and the Romans Catholic Church. The Pope also holds the title of "Bishop of Rome".

  Religion  
The religion of the city is the  Roman Catholic Church .
