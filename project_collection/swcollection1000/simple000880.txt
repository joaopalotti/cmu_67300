This makes Poland the 77th largest country  ref name CIAWFBook  in the world with over 38.5 million people. Most Polish people live in large cities, including the capital,  Warsaw  ( Polish language Polish :  Warszawa ),  Lodz ,  Krakow Cracow  ( Polish language Polish :  Krakow ), the second capital of Poland (first was  Gniezno ),  Szczecin ,  Gdansk ,  Wroclaw  and  Poznan .

The word "Poland" was written officially for the first time in 966. In 1569, Poland formed a strong union with Lithuania called the  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth . At some point in its history, it was the largest  state  in Europe and became very influential. Much of the territory that now makes up Central European states used to belong to that Commonwealth. Eventually, after a slow decline, the Commonwealth  Partitions of Poland collapsed  in 1795. Poland regained its  independence  in 1918 after  World War I . In 1921, Poland defeated Soviet Russia in the  Polish-Soviet War  that started in 1919.

However, Poland lost independence again not long after the beginning of  World War II , after suffering a defeat by both the  USSR  and  Nazi Germany . Although the government collapsed, the Polish people fought on by forming the largest and most effective resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. It is most notable for disrupting German supply lines to the Eastern Front of WWII, providing military intelligence to the  United Kingdom British , and for saving more  Jews Jewish  lives in the  Holocaust  than any other  Allies of World War II Allied  organization or government. After the war, Poland regained "independence" and became a  People's Republic of Poland communist country  within the  Eastern Bloc . The new government was appointed by  Joseph Stalin  and was under the control of the  Soviet Union .

In 1989, Poland ceased being a communist country and became a  liberal democracy . Its change of government was the first in a series of events that led to the states of Eastern and Central Europe regaining their  independence  and the fall of the USSR in 1991. After the  democratic consolidation , Poland joined the  European Union  on 1 May 2004. Poland is also a member of  NATO , the  United Nations , and the  World Trade Organization .

  History  
 main History of Poland 
  Before Piasts  
The first sign of humans in Polish lands was 500,000 years ago. The  Bronze Age  started around 2400-2300  BC . The  Iron Age  started around 750-700  BC . At that time the Polish lands were under the influence of the  Lusatian culture . About 400 BC  Celts Celtic  and  Germanic people Germanic  tribes lived there. Those people had trade contacts with the  Roman Empire .

Over time,  Slavs  came to Polish lands. Some of those Slavs, now commonly referred to as Western Slavs (though in reality a diverse group of tribes with shared ethnic and cultural features), stayed there and started to create new nations. The most powerful tribe was called the  Polans , who united all of the other Slavic tribes living there, and this is where the name "Poland" comes from.

  Piast and Jagiellon dynasties  
 File:Poland1020.png thumb|left|Poland around 1020 
Poland began to form into a country around the middle of the  10th century  in the  Piast dynasty . In 966, Prince  Mieszko I  became a  Christian , and so the Polish people also became Christians. The next king was  Boleslaw I of Poland  (called Boleslaw the Brave). He conquered many lands and he became the first King of Poland.  Casimir I of Poland  changed the Polish capital from  Gniezno  to  Krakow . In the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller  states  after the death of King  Boleslaw III Wrymouth  in  1138  because of his  will (law) will . Those states were later attacked by  Mongol  armies in  1241 , which slowed down the unification of the small states into the big country of Poland. This happened eighty years later, in  1320 , when  Wladyslaw I of Poland Wladyslaw I  became the King of the United Poland. His son  Casimir III  the Great reformed the Polish economy, built new castles and won the war against the  Ruthenian Dukedom . Many people  emigration emigrated  to Poland, becoming a haven for emigrants . A large number of  Jewish  people also moved into Poland during that time. The  Black Death , which affected many parts of  Europe  from  1347  to  1351 , did not come to Poland. ref name REF03 Teeple, J. B. (2002).  Timelines of World History . Publisher: DK Adult. ref 

After the death of the last Piast on the Polish throne,  Casimir III of Poland Casimir III ,  Louis I of Hungary  and his daughter  Jadwiga of Poland  began their rule. She married the  Lithuania n prince  Jogaila . Their marriage started a new dynasty in Poland: the  Jagiellon dynasty . Under the  Jagiellon dynasty , Poland made an alliance with its neighbor  Lithuania .

  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to II Republic of Poland

In the 17th century  Sweden  attacked almost all of Poland (this was called "the Deluge"). Many wars against the  Ottoman Empire ,  Russia ,  Cossacks ,  Transylvania  and  Brandenburg-Prussia  ended in  1699 . For the next 80 years, the government and the nation were weak, making Poland dependent on Russia. Russian  tsars  took advantage of this by offering money to dishonest members of the Polish  government , who would block new ideas and solutions.  Russia ,  Prussia , and  Austria  broke Poland into three pieces in  1772 ,  1793  and  1795 , which dissolved the country. Before the second split, a  Constitution  called " The Constitution of 3 May " was made in 1791. The Polish people did not like the new kings, and often rebelled (two big  rebellion s in 1830 ref name REF03  and 1863 fact date April 2009 ).
 Napoleon  made another Polish state, "the  Duchy of Warsaw ", but after the  Napoleonic wars , Poland was split again by the countries at the  Congress of Vienna . The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar. 
During  World War I  all the  Allies of World War I Allies  agreed to save Poland. Soon after the surrender of Germany in November  1918 , Poland became the  Second Polish Republic  ( II Rzeczpospolita Polska ). It got its freedom after several military conflicts; the largest was in  1919 - 1921   Polish-Soviet War .

  World War II  
 File:Rzeczpospolita 1922.png thumb|left|Poland 1922-1938 
On  September 1 ,  1939 ,  World War II  started when  Nazi Germany  attacked Poland. The  Soviet Union  attacked Poland on September 17, 1939.  Warsaw  was defeated on  September 28 , 1939. Poland was split up into two pieces, one half owned by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union. More than 6 million Polish people died, and half of these people were  Polish Jews Jewish . Most of these deaths were part of the  Holocaust , in which 6 million Jews were killed. At the war's end, Poland's borders were moved west, pushing the eastern border to the  Curzon line . ref In first version of that line western  Ukraine  with  Lviv  may come to Poland ref  The western border was moved to the  Oder-Neisse line . The new Poland became 20% smaller by 77,500 square kilometers (29,900 sq mi). The shift forced millions of Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews to move.

After these events Poland gradually became a  communism communist  country. It was supposedly an independent country.  But in reality the new government was appointed by  Joseph Stalin .  It was also under the control of the  Soviet Union . The country was then renamed the  People's Republic of Poland . There are many Poles in the neighboring countries  Ukraine ,  Belarus , and Lithuania (these three countries were part of the Soviet Union until 1991), as well as in other countries. The most Poles outside of Poland are in the United States, especially in  Chicago . Germany and the  United Kingdom  are also home to a large Polish diaspora. The most recent mass emigration of Poles to western countries began after 1989.

In 1989  Solidarity  - a  trade union  led by  Lech Walesa  - helped defeat the communist government in Poland. Even before that event, Lech Walesa was given a  Nobel Prize  for leading the first non-communist trade union fighting for democracy in the  Eastern Bloc Communist Block . When Communism ended in Poland there were many improvements in human rights, such as  freedom of speech ,  democracy , etc. In 1991 Poland became a member of the  Visegrad Group  and joined  NATO  in 1999 along with the  Czech Republic  and  Hungary . Polish voters then voted to join the  European Union  in a vote in June 2003. The country joined the  EU  on May 1, 2004.

Currently, the Prime Minister is  Ewa Kopacz . On 10 April 2010 the President  Lech Kaczynski  died in a government plane crash in  Smolensk  in  Russia . The president is elected directly by the citizens for a five-year  term . The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and confirmed by the "Sejm". The Sejm is the lower chamber of Parliament  legislature  for the country. It has 460 deputies  elect ed every four years.

  Geography  
Poland's territory is a  plain  reaching from the  Baltic Sea  in the north to the  Carpathian Mountains  in the south. Within that plain, the land varies from east to west.

The Polish Baltic coast is mostly smooth but has natural  harbor s in the  Tricity Gdansk-Gdynia  region and  Szczecin  in the far northwest. This coast has several  spit s,  dune s and coastal lakes. Coast lakes are former  bay s that have been cut off from the sea. These areas are sometimes called lagoons.  Szczecin Lagoon  is on the western border with  Germany . The  Vistula Lagoon  is on the eastern border with  Kaliningrad , province of  Russia . The longest river in Poland, the  Vistula  river, empties into the  Vistula Lagoon  and also directly into the  Baltic Sea .

The northeastern region is densely wooded, sparsely populated and lacks agricultural and industrial resources. The geographical region has four hilly  district s of  moraine s and lakes created by moraines. These formed during and after the  Pleistocene   ice age . The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four districts and covers much of northeastern Poland.

Poland has many lakes. In Europe only  Finland  has more lakes. The largest lakes are  Sniardwy  and  Lake Mamry Mamry . In addition to the lake districts in the north, there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the  Tatras Mountains Tatras mountains .

South of the northeastern region is the regions of  Silesia  and  Masovia , which are marked by broad ice age river  valley s. Silesia region has many resources and people.  Coal  is abundant. Lower Silesia has large  copper  mining.  Mazovian Lowland Masovian Plain  is in central Poland. It is in the valleys of three large rivers:  Vistula ,  Bug River Bug  and  Narew .

Further south is the Polish mountain region. These mountains include the  Sudetes  and the  Carpathian Mountains . The highest part of the Carpathians is the Tatra mountains which is along Poland's southern border. The tallest mountain in Poland,  Rysy  at 2,503 m (8,210 ft), is in the  High Tatras .

Poland is made of sixteen  region s known as  voivodeship s ( wojewodztwa , singular -  wojewodztwo ). They are basically created from the country's historical regions, whereas those of the past two decades (till  1998 ) had been focused on and named for separate cities. The new units range in areas from under 10,000 km sup 2 sup  (Opole Voivodeship) to over 35,000 km sup 2 sup  (Masovian Voivodeship). Voivodeships are controlled by voivod governments, and their legislatures are called  voivodeship sejmik s.

The sixteen voivodeships that make up Poland are further divided into  powiat y  (singular  powiat ), second-level units of  Local government administration , which are about the same as to a  county ,  district  or  prefecture  in other countries.

  People  
 main Poles 
In the past, Poland was inhabited by people from different nations and of different religions (mainly  Roman Catholicism Catholics ,  Eastern Orthodox Church Orthodox  and  Judaism ). This changed after  1939 , because of the  Nazism Nazi   Holocaust  which killed many Polish Jews. After  World War II , the country was changed into a  Communism communist  country, by the  Warsaw Pact  which included most central European countries and Russia  Russia .

Today 38,038,000 people live in Poland (2011). In 2002 96.74% of the population call themselves Polish, while 471,500 people (1.23%) claimed another nationality. 774,900 people (2.03%) did not declare any nationality. Nationalities, or  ethnicity ethnic groups  in Poland are  Silesians ,  Germans  (most in the former  Opole Voivodeship ),  Ukraine Ukrainians ,  Lithuania ns,  Russia ns,  Jew s and  Belarus ians. The  Polish language  is part of the  West Slavs West Slavic  section of the  Slavic languages . It is also the  official language  of Poland.  English language English  and  German language German  are the most common second languages studied and spoken.

In the past few years, Poland's population has gone down because of an increase in  emigrate emigration  and a sharp drop in the birth rate. In  2006 , the census office estimated the total population of Poland at 38,536,869, a very small rise on the 2002 figure of 38,230,080. Since Poland's accession to the  European Union , a large number of Polish people have moved to work in Western European countries like the  United Kingdom  and the  Republic of Ireland . Some organizations state people have left because of high  unemployment  (10.5%) and better opportunities for work somewhere else. In April 2007, the Polish population of the  United Kingdom  had risen to about 300,000 people and estimates predict about 65,000 Polish people living in the  Republic of Ireland . However, in recent years strong growth of Polish economy and increasing value of Polish currency (PLN) makes many Polish immigrants to go back home. In 2007, the number of people leaving the country was lower than people who are coming back. Poland became an attractive place to work for people from other countries (mainly Ukraine).

A Polish minority is still present in neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries. The largest number of ethnic Poles outside of the country can be found in the  United States .
