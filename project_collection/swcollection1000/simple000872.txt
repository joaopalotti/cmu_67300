Drunk driving

Drunk driving  ( Drink driving  in the  United Kingdom UK  and  Australia ) is the act of driving a  motor   vehicle  ( car ,  truck , etc.) while under the effects of  ethanol alcohol .  Drunk driving is  illegal  in most areas of the world.  In some places, driving a motorless vehicle such as a  bicycle  while drunk is also illegal.

Most  areas that make laws  ( jurisdiction s ) started with DWI (driving while  intoxication intoxicated ) laws, banning just alcohol. Later, most changed them to DUI (driving under the  influence ) laws, adding other  drug s to those banned while driving. The most common  blood alcohol content  (BAC) limit in the  United States  is 0.08% for the legal meaning of drunk. Only three states still use the more lax, original standard of 0.10%.  Many jurisdictions add extra  punishment penalties  (more jail time and/or a longer  DUI program ) in cases where the driver's BAC is over 0.20%.

 History of drunk driving laws 

The first place in the  United States  to adopt laws against drunk driving was the  state  of  New York  in  1910 , with  California  ( 1911 ) and others doing the same later. Early laws simply banned driving while drunk, with no mention of what BAC was banned (which means how drunk the person is). The state of Georgia was one of the last states to make laws against drunk driving. One of the years with the most alcohol related crashes was 1982. The year 1982 had 26,173 alcohol related deaths due to drunk driving.

In the US, most of the laws were greatly tightened in the early  1980s , largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) and  http://www.yaerd.org Young Adults Educating Responsible Drinking .
