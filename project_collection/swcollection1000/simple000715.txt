Semiotics

Semiotics  (or  semiology ) is a theoretical  framework  for the study of the meaning of  language ,  sign s and  symbols . It was first developed in the early  20th century , separately, by the Swiss  Ferdinand Saussure  and  Charles Sanders Peirce  of the U.S.A. It can be described as both a  science  and a  technique : a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning.

 Semiotics  is usually divided into three parts:
 Semantics  -  what was the meaning of the words or signs used; 
 Pragmatics  - who said it, to whom and in what circumstances and 
 Syntactics  - the formal rules of the language used.

The major branches of semiotics include:
 Biosemiotics 
 Zoosemiotics 
 Semiotics of culture
