There is very heavy  rainfall  along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the  desert s of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily,  drought s (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible.
