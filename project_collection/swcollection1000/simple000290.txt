 File:Puerta_de_Alcal%C3%A1_2.jpg thumb|left|200px|Puerta de Alcala 
During the history of  Spain  many different people have lived there. The  Phoenician s came in 1100 BC, followed by  Carthaginian s,  Roman Empire Roman s,  Vandals ,  Visigoth s and  Moor s. It was not until  1492 , when the  Catholic Monarchs  got power, that Spain became a united country.  Jew s and Moors, who had lived happily there for many years, were driven away. Spain became very rich because it conquered many overseas countries, especially in  Central America Central  and  South America . However, Spain fought many wars and lost much of its  treasure . It was very poor in  1936  when the  Civil War  was fought. General Franco became a harsh  dictator  until  1975  when  Juan Carlos I  was brought back to Spain and made king. There is now a democratic government.

In  prehistoric  times people lived in the area which is now Madrid. The Romans lived there for several centuries. The origin of today's city really starts in the  9th century  when Muhammad I had a small  palace  built where the Palacio Real stands today. The Moors built strong forts in Madrid in  865  and put a wall round the city. These walls stood until  1476  when they were knocked down. In  1561   Felipe I  moved the royal court from  Toledo, Spain Toledo  to Madrid. Madrid had now become the capital of a very large  empire . Over the next years and  decade s the  Plaza Mayor  was built and many great buildings and monuments, many of which still stand.

When  Ferdinand II of Aragon  and Queen  Isabella of Castile  came to Madrid, Spain had become a very rich country. The  16th century 16th  and  17th century 17th centuries  are now known as the "Golden Century". Their grandson was the famous  Charles I of Spain  (also known as  Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor ). He liked his court to be in  Sevilla Seville . His son,  Philip II of Spain Philip II  (1527-1598) moved the  court  to Madrid in 1561. 
  
In the late 1800s there was a revolt, known as the  First Spanish Republic . Later the monarchy was restored, but then there was a  Second Spanish Republic  followed by the  Spanish Civil War . The Second Spanish Republic started on 14 April 1931 and was celebrated in La puerta del Sol which is the center of the city. Madrid suffered a lot in this war. It was bombed by airplanes.

During the  dictatorship  of  Francisco Franco , especially during the  1960 s, the south of Madrid became very industrialized, and many people from the  rural  areas moved to Madrid especially to the south east of the city.

When General Franco had died and democracy was restored, Madrid became more prosperous. During the  1980 s and  1990 s many new buildings were put up.

  Geography  
The region of Madrid has quite a dry climate. Most rain falls in  autumn  and  spring . The winters are cold because it is so high up, and sometimes there is snow. The summers are hot. Often the temperature is above 30 degC (86 degF) in July and can often reach 40 degC (104 degF). At night it is much cooler. This is why people have a sleep (siesta) in the afternoon when it is too hot to do anything. Then they come out again in the evening and often eat dinner late at night.
