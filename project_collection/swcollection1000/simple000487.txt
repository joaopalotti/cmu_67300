The  Ten Commandments , according to the book of  Exodus  in the  Bible , are rules for life given by  God  to  Moses  on  Biblical Mount Sinai Mount Sinai  to give to the  Jew People of Israel . ref ( bibleverse Exodus 19:23 HE ),  cite web  url http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/G-dAtSinai.htm   title Did God speak at Mt. Sinai  accessdate 2008-07-21  format   work SimpleToRemember.com  ref  Although the Book of  Deuteronomy  talks about Mount Horeb, ref bibleverse Deuteronomy 5:2 HE ref  it is often considered to have been a different name for the same place. The rules were written on stone tablets. These rules are important for  Judaism  and  Christianity .

Sometimes these rules are also called  Decalogue  (from  Greek language Greek , can be translated as  ten statements ). The name decalogue first occurs in the  Septuagint . The Jews received the commandments after they had left  Egypt  during the reign of  Pharaoh   Ramses . There are different  text s talking about the commandments. Most of them are in the  Bible : The Book of  Exodus , Chapter 20 and the book of  Deuteronomy , Chapter 5. The  Qu'ran  mentions the tablets but does not list the commandments.
Because the Bible has been translated many times, there are variations in the way the commandments are written.

  In the Bible  
The Bible in Basic English ref cite web  url http://basicenglishbible.com/exodus/20.htm   title Exodus 20: Bible in Basic English  accessdate 2008-07-21  format   work BasicEnglishBible.com  ref   translation translates  the commandments from Exodus in this way:

   sup 1  And God said all these words:  sup 2  I am the Lord took you out of the land of  Egypt , out of the  prison -house.  sup 3  You are to have no other gods but me.
   sup 4  You are not to make an image or picture of anything in  heaven  or on the  earth  or in the waters under the earth:  sup 5  You may not go down on your faces before them or give them  worship : for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth  generation  of my haters;  sup 6  And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.
   sup 7  You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a  sin ner by the Lord
   sup 8  Keep in memory the  Sabbath  and let it be a holy day.  sup 9  On six days do all your work:  sup 10  But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man- servant  or your woman-servant, your  cattle  or the man from a strange country who is living among you:  sup 11  For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.
   sup 12  Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
   sup 13  Do not  death penalty put anyone to death  without cause.
   sup 14  Do not be false to the  marriage married  relation.
   sup 15  Do not take the  property  of another.
   sup 16  Do not give false  wikt:witness witness  against your neighbor.
   sup 17  Let not your desire be turned to your neighbor's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his  donkey ass  or anything which is his.

 Differences in teachings and interpretation 
These commandments are translated from ancient  Hebrew language Hebrew  to  Basic English , so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews. There are a variety of interpretations of these commandments:
 Images

 File:Sun and Moon creation.jpg thumb|right|300px| The Creation of the Sun and the Moon  is a  fresco  in the  Sistine Chapel . It was done by  Michelangelo . It shows an image of God. 

One understanding on the commandment to not make "any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above" is as from  Roman Catholicism : they hold that "likenesses" may be built and used, as long as the object is not  worship ped. The  Eastern Orthodox Church  has a very similar position. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the  incarnation  of an  visible spectrum invisible  God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it alright to worship images (see  Iconoclasm ). But, for Jews, Muslims, and most other Christians that violates the commandment.

 Jehovah's Witnesses  criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. The  Amish  forbid any sort of image, such as  photography photos .

 Sabbath day
 main Sabbath Shabbat 

Jews honor the Sabbath  (Shabbat)  on Saturday, the seventh day of the week on the  Hebrew calendar Jewish calendar .

Most  Christians  honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the  Resurrection  of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar.

Some conservative Christians are "Sabbatarians" (most of these follow the  Reformation Reformed   tradition s). Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or  Lord's Day  is the new Sabbath, because the 4th commandment has never been  revoke d and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation  ordinance .

Others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday, while Sunday as a day of worship, in reference to Acts 20:7: the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. Also, Jesus appeared to his followers on the "first day of the week" while they were in hiding.

The  Seventh-day Adventist Church , and some others, believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in  paganism , specifically  Sol Invictus  and  Mithraism  (in which  sun   god  worship took place on Sunday). Instead, Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation ref bibleverse Genesis 2:1-3 9 ,  bibleverse Exodus 20:8-11 9 ,  bibleverse Exodus 16:23,29-30 9 ref  believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed. ref bibleverse Matthew 5:17-19 9 ,  bibleverse Exodus 31:16 9 ref  Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the  2nd century 2nd  and  3rd century , but because of opposition to Judaism after the  Jewish-Roman wars , the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship.

 Married relations

To "be false to the married relation", called  adultery , is when a married person has  sexual intercourse sexual relations  with a person other than his or her spouse. The Bible does not say whether or not this includes unmarried people having sex with each other, although some people think so.

 Killing or murder

There are different  translation s of this commandment; the Hebrew words  lang he l trtskh  are translated either as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the  Vulgate  and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it "Thou shalt not  kill ". Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use "You shall not  murder ". There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original.

The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that "murder" is more accurate.  Furthermore, the Hebrew word for "kill" is " lang he hrg " - " harog ", while the Hebrew word for "murder" is " lang he rtskh " - " retzach ", which is found in the Ten Commandments " lang he l trtskh " - " lo tirtzach ".

In the  New Testament ,  Jesus  talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments. He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person, he might be judged for murder, and if he just looked with desire or  lust  at a woman, he had committed adultery in his heart. ref bibleverse Matthew 5:28 9 ref 

 Stealing

Many  Theology theologians  (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt:  Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog  (1953)) suggest that commandment "you shall not steal" was originally intended against stealing people--abductions and  slavery . This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as "you shall not kidnap" (e.g. as stated by Rashi).

 False witness

To "give false witness" called  lying , may include all lying, or only lying in court, which is called  perjury .

  Different numbering  
The Bible does not number the commandments. Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways. The Jews, followed by Christian  Protestant s, end the first commandment with "You are to have no other gods but me." as above.  Catholic s and  Lutheran s end the first commandment at "I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws." and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man's wife from the desire for other things he owns.

The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten important statements, there are 14 or 15 in all. While the Bible itself gives the count as "10", using the Hebrew phrase  `aseret had'varim --translated as  the 10 words ,  statements  or  things , this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being "the Ten Commandments". ref bibleverse Exodus 34:28 HE ,  bibleverse Deuteronomy 4:13 HE ,  bibleverse Deuteronomy 10:4 HE ref  Various religions divide the commandments differently.

  Muslim understanding  
 Islam  teaches that the Bible is a  revelation  from God, but that the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been  wikt:corrupt corrupted . The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the  Qur'an , but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran.

  "There is no other god beside God."( cite quran 47 19 style ref )
  "My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and protect me and my children from worshiping  idol s." ( cite quran 14 35 style ref )
  "Do not subject God's name to your casual swearing, that you may appear  righteousness righteous ,  piety pious , or to get  wikt:credibility credibility  among the people." ( cite quran 2 224 style ref )
  "O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu`ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business." ( cite quran 62 9 style ref ) ref The Sabbath was abandoned with the revelation of the Quran. Muslims are told in the Quran that the Sabbath was only decreed for the Jews. ( cite quran 16 124 style ref ) God, however, ordered Muslims to make every effort and drop all businesses to attend the congregational (Friday) prayer. The Submitters may tend to their business during the rest of the day. ref 
  "....and your parents shall be honored. As long as one or both of them live, you shall never say to them, "Uff" (the slightest gesture of annoyance), nor shall you shout at them; you shall treat them  wikt:amicable amicably ." ( cite quran 17 23 style ref )
  "....anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes, it shall be as if he murdered all the people." (5:32)
  "You shall not commit  adultery ; it is a gross sin, and an evil behavior." ( cite quran 17 32 style ref )
  "The  theft thief , male or female, you shall mark their hands as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as an example from God.  God is Almighty, Most Wise." ( cite quran 5 38 39 style ref )
  "Do not withhold any  wikt:testimony testimony  by  wikt:conceal concealing  what you had witnessed. Anyone who withholds a testimony is sinful at heart." ( cite quran 2 283 style ref )
  "And do not want what we bestowed upon any other people. Such are temporary ornaments of this life, whereby we put them to the test. What your Lord provides for you is far better, and everlasting." ( cite quran 20 131 style ref )

  Other religions  
In general, religions other than those mentioned (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) do not recognise the Ten Commandments as  Ethics ethical standards . Many of them ( Buddhism ,  Hinduism ,  Jainism , etc.) have similar laws or principles though. ref cite web url http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/WorldScr/WS-02-03.htm title World Scripture: The Decalogue by Andrew Wilson accessdate 2008-01-26 ref 
In the  atheist   Soviet Union  the  Moral Code of the Builder of Communism  was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments.

 The Ritual Decalogue 

The term "Ten Commandments" generally applies to the list mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. However, there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 (where the stones are created), Exodus 32:19 (where the tablets are broken) and Exodus 34. This story lists a very different set of commandments. This version is sometimes called "Ritual Decalogue".  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  and the people after him who followed the  documentary hypothesis , note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones. These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments, and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments, now known as the  Ritual Decalogue  (as opposed to the better-known "Ethical Decalogue"). The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments.

  Influence  
The commandments have influenced Jewish  ethics  and  law  and, through  Judaism  and  Christianity , Western  ethics  and  law  since the  Roman Empire . ref * Cite book last  Coogan  first  Michael  year  2014  title  The Ten Commandments; A Short History of an Ancient Text  publisher Yale University Press  location   isbn 9780300178715 ref   Moses is the founder of basis of the philosophy of law as well as such modern legal doctrines as independent judiciary and separation of powers. ref Barenboim Peter,  http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers , Moscow, Letny Sad, 2005 .
