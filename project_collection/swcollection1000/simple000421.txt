Reward

A  reward  is getting something good for doing a given task.  It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing. It is the opposite of  punishment .

Ideas like  risk and reward ,  reward and punishment  are based on the idea that people do things, or avoid doing things, to get rewards. In  psychology  there is another idea that this is not true. This other idea says that training ( conditioning ) and emotions ( affective factor s) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others.

In trying to catch criminals and other bad people, the  government  often offers money to people. This money is given to people who may capture the criminal, or give information that helps the police catch them. For example after the  Eureka Stockade   rebellion  in  Ballarat, Victoria  in 1854, the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it.
