A  vocabulary  is a list of  word s.

The vocabulary a person uses is all the words that person uses. A person who is five knows 4,000 to 5,000 words. ref Nation, Paul, and Robert Waring. 1997. Vocabulary size, text coverage and word lists.  Vocabulary: Description, acquisition and pedagogy , 6-19.  http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fltr/germ/etan/bibs/vocab/cup.html ref   Adult s who go to  college  may know 20,000 words. ref Goulden R; Nation P. & Read J. 1990.

The number of words in a  language  is more than of the words. One dictionary may have a list of 500,000 (half a  million ) words. Another dictionary may have some other words that the other dictionary does not have. When you add all the words in those dictionaries, there are about 750,000 words in  English language English . There may be more words than that. ref name Crystal Crystal, David 1995.  The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language . Cambridge University Press, p119, p423. ref 

If there are 750,000 words, how can we talk with only 3000 words? Because, we do not need all the words. You can say most things with 3000 words. ref Adolphs and Schmitt 2003. Lexical coverage of spoken discourse. http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/425.full.pdf+html ref  

The most used words are short words. That is true in all languages. ref Zipf G.K. 1949.  Human behavior and the principle of least effort . Cambridge, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley. ref  The 50 most common words in English have less than seven letters. Half of these words have less than four letters. ref name Crystal  

The vocabulary of a language is always changing.  New words are made or words change their meaning. Words about  computer s, like "download" are new to the  English language . The new word "bling" came from  hip hop .  Words like "cool" have developed new meanings.
