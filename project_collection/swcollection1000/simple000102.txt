Cytology

Cytology  is the study of the  cell s, especially their appearance and  structure . Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their  environment .

There are two types of cells.  Prokaryote Prokaryotic  cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see  Cell nucleus nucleus , and do not have a  membrane , or wall, around them.  Eukaryote Eukaryotic  cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main  organelle s of a cell and their uses are: 
   Mitochondria : produces  energy  for the cell
   Endoplasmic reticulum : makes  protein s and  carbohydrate s for the cell to use
   Golgi body Golgi bodies : store and package products that the cell uses
  Plastid (present in plant cells only): contains chemicals needed to  photosynthesis photosynthesize  (create energy from sunlight); in plants only.
  Nucleus: directs the actions of the cell
   Centrosome s: guides the cell in  mitosis  and  meiosis , the processes for cell division.

 Cell biology  is mostly about how cells work, and about  cell division  and  molecular biology .
 Histology  deals with techniques for looking at tissues under a  microscope .
