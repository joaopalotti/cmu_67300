Slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people. ref name HistWld  Once men gathered in  cities  and  towns  and there was more than enough food, having a cheap supply of labor made sense. ref name HistWld  This is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared. Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the  Code of Hammurabi  (c. 1760 BC). This refers to it as an established institution. ref cite web url http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM   archiveurl https://web.archive.org/web/20110514033802/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM   archivedate 14 May 2011  title  Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi quote e.g. Prologue, "the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves" Code of Laws No. 307, "If any one buy from the son or the slave of another man". ref 

In the Ancient Near East, captives obtained through warfare often became slaves. This was seen by the  law s in the  Bible  book of   Deuteronomy  as a legal form of slavery. But the  Israelites  were not allowed to enslave other Israelites. The Deuteronomic Code calls for the  death penalty  for the  crime  of  kidnapping  Israelites to enslave them.

In  Ancient Egypt , slaves were mainly prisoners of war. Other ways people could become slaves was by  Inheritance inheriting  the status from their parents who were slaves. Someone could become a slave if he could not pay his  debt s. People also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor  peasant s and needed  food  and  shelter . The lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants. ref name touregypt1 cite web url http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/slaves.htm   title Slaves and Slavery in Ancient Egypt  publisher Touregypt.net  date 2011-10-24  accessdate 2015-10-18 ref  Young slaves could not be put to hard work, and had to be brought up by the mistress of the  household . Not all slaves went to houses. Some also sold themselves to  temple s, or were assigned to temples by the  king . Slave trading was not very popular until later in Ancient Egypt. Afterwards, slave trades sprang up all over Egypt.

  Slavery in ancient Rome  
Roman slaves played an important  role  in  society  and the economy. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many  Domestic worker domestic services . They could work at highly skilled jobs and  profession s.  Teacher s,  accountant s, and  physician s were often slaves.  Greece Greek  slaves were often  Education highly educated . Unskilled slaves, or those sentenced to slavery as  punishment , worked on  farm s, in  Mining mine s, and at  mill (grinding) mill s. Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short.

Slaves were considered property under  Roman law  and had no legal personhood. Unlike  Roman citizen s, they could be subjected to corporal punishment,  Sexual abuse sexual exploitation  ( prostitute s were often slaves),  torture , and  Execution summary execution . The testimony of a slave could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortured--a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters' affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced. Over time, however, slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. Attitudes changed in part because of the influence among the educated elite of the  Stoicism Stoics , whose  Egalitarianism egalitarian  views of humanity extended to slaves.

Roman slaves could hold  property  which, even though it belonged to their  wikt:master master s, they were allowed to use as if it were their own. Skilled or educated slaves were allowed to earn their own  money . With enough money they could buy their freedom. ref Dennis P.

  Slavery today  
Millions of people are still slaves in some parts of the world, mostly in  South Asia  and  Africa . It is less common in the  First World developed world  because of better  law enforcement , but it still happens there as well.  ref name BBC Millions 'forced into slavery'  The ways in which it is done have changed. Today, slaves may work because of things like a high  debt  (for example, slaves have to work to pay off a debt). Many victims are told that their families will be harmed if they report the slave owners. Many slaves are forced to be domestic servants. In some cases, their families sell them to the slave owners. Some slaves have been trafficked from one part of the world to another. These people are illegally in their host country, and therefore do not report the abuse. Forced  prostitution  is a type of slavery. Another form of slavery still happening today is forced  child labor . Some children have to work in  Mining mines  or in  plantation s, or they have to fight wars as  child soldier s, for no pay. 

One study says that there are 27 million people (but others say there could be as many as 200 million) in slavery today. ref Kevin Bales,  Disposable People ref 

Other terms that describe the recruitement of laborers, and that may have similarities to slavery are  Blackbirding ,  Impressment  and  Shanghaiing .

  Stopping slavery  
An agitation called  Abolitionism  against slavery began in Christian countries in the 18th century. First they abolished the  slave trade  so more people wouldn't become slaves. In 1833, the  British Empire  stopped slavery. Several other countries followed. In the  United States , disagreement over slavery led to the  American Civil War  and the  Emancipation Proclamation . In 1865, when the North won, all slaves were made free. Still more countries abolished slavery afterwards.  Pedro II of Brazil  abolished it in 1888. Forced labor however continued, either against the law or by debt  peon age or other methods which the laws of the various countries did not count as slavery.
