"To  wikt:google google ," as an action word ( verb ) means "to search for something on Google".

  History  
Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at  Stanford University , USA. It used to be called Backrub. they made it into a company, Google Inc., on  September 7 ,  1998  at a friend's garage in  Menlo Park, California Menlo Park ,  California . In February  1999 , the company moved to 165 University Ave.,  Palo Alto, California .  it moved to another place called the Googleplex.

In September 2001, Google's rating system (PageRank, for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S.  Patent . The patent was to Stanford University, with Lawrence (Larry) Page as the  inventor  (the person who first had the idea).

Google makes a percentage of its money through  America Online  and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make  contract s, helps making accounts better, and gives engineering help.

 How Google makes money 
Google makes money by  advertising . People or companies who want people to buy their product, service, or ideas give Google money, and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement. Google only gets money when people click on the link, so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the "right people". It does this with Google Analytics, which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site. From this and other data, Google makes a profile about the person, which it then uses to figure out which advertisements to show.

  The name "Google"  
The name "Google" is a misspelling of the word  googol . ref Koller, David. " http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html Origin of the name, "Google."   Stanford University .  January, 2004. ref ref name hiw citation title Google revolution publisher Imagine Publishing newspaper How it Works pages 40-43 issue 37 date 2012-08-09 ref   Milton Sirotta , nephew of U.S. mathematician  Edward Kasner , made this word in 1938, for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes ( math 10^{100} math ). It is said that the word "googol" was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk. fact date August 2016 
 Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim thought of the name. 

The name for Google's main office, the "Googleplex," is a play on a different, even bigger number, the " googolplex ", which is 1 followed by one googol of zeroes.
