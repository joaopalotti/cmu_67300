 Oahu  (or  O`ahu ) is the third largest of the  Hawaiian Islands , in the  United States . It means "the gathering place" (a place where people meet) in the  Hawaiian language . Most of the people of Hawaii live there (1.2 million of the state's 1.7 million in the mid-1990s). The total land area is  convert 608 mi2 km2 .  Honolulu , the capital city of Hawaii, is on this island. Other well-known places on Oahu are  Waikiki ,  Pearl Harbor ,  Diamond Head ,  Hanauma Bay ,  Kaneohe Bay , and both the North Shore and Makaha (which are famous for very big ocean waves). 

 Kamehameha I  made Oahu his capital when he became the first king of Hawaii.  Iolani Palace  was built later on by others of the royal family. It is the only royal palace on American soil. 

Oahu was perhaps the first of the Hawaiian Islands which the crew of  HMS Resolution  saw on 18 January 1778. This was during Captain  James Cook 's third  Pacific Ocean  trip. Europeans did not land on Oahu until 28 February 1779 when Captain Clerke of the  HMS Resolution  stepped ashore at  Waimea Bay . Clerke took command of the ship after Captain Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14.

Today, Oahu has become a tourism and shopping center. Almost 7 million visitors (mainly from the  United States American mainland  and  Japan ) go there every year to enjoy the special island holiday found only in Hawaii.

Oahu can be seen in hundreds of movies and TV shows. Some of them are  Magnum, P.I. ,  Lost (TV series) Lost ,  Hawaii Five-O  and  Jake and the Fatman .
