 Taiwan  (also known as  Formosa ) officially the Republic of China (ROC; Chinese: Zhong Hua Min Guo ; pinyin: Zhonghua Minguo), is a state in East Asia. It is the nationalist government of China since its settlement in 1949. It is called the   Republic of China  (ROC)  (also called  Taiwan ) which is a special region comprising the island of Taiwan and nearby islands ( Pescadores  islands and parts of  Fujian ). The Chinese Nationalist government ( Kuomintang  also called KMT) moved to Taiwan after the Communist army took over the capital of Beijing. Currently, the Chinese Nationalist government governs  Taipei , the capital of Taiwan. Taiwan is southeast of the  People's Republic of China China  mainland, south of  Japan , and north of the  Philippines .

Formosa is the Portuguese name of Taiwan, which means "beautiful" in  Portuguese language Portuguese .

The largest cities in Taiwan are the  Capital (city) capital  of  Taipei  and the port city of  Kaohsiung .

Most people living in Taiwan (sometimes called Taiwanese) are  Han . There are also  Taiwanese Aborigines  who have lived in Taiwan before the Han came to live there.

Taiwan has three large Han groups. They speak different  dialect s of Chinese and their ancestors came from different places: the Southern Fujianese (from China's  Fujian Fujian Province ), the  Hakka people Hakka  (from China), and Mainlanders (from  Mainland China  after 1948).

  History  
  1517: A  Portugal Portuguese  ship sees the island and names it "Ilha Formosa", or "Beautiful Island" in  Portuguese language Portuguese .
  17th century: From 1624 until 1661  Dutch (people) Dutch  colonize the southern part of Formosa and established a colonial administration in  Fort Zeelandia , and the  Spain Spanish  colonize the north and established a colonial administration in Fuerte Santo Domingo or  Fort Santo Domingo .  The Dutch eventually defeated the  Spaniard s and took full control of Formosa. A Chinese general named  Koxinga , defeated the Dutch at the  Siege of Fort Zeelandia .
  1860: Taiwan becomes a  treaty port  following the  Treaty of Tientsin , opening the island to contact with the world.
  1874:  Japan  invaded southern Taiwan, seemingly to "punish" the aborigines there for the murder of ship-wrecked Okinawan fishermen in 1871, but actually to establish a colony. Japanese forced withdraw later in the year after the  Meiji  and  Qing  empires nearly went to war.
  1884-1885: Taiwan is blockaded by French navy during the  Sino-Franco  War.
  1895: Qing China lost the  First Sino-Japanese War  and gave Taiwan to  Japan  permanently.
  1945: Japan lost in  World War II  to USA and gave up Taiwan permanently.
  1946: USA accepts millions refugees and soldiers from China to Taiwan and USA President installs  The Republic of China  to govern Taiwan and to fight China and  communism .  
  1947: Taiwanese widely protest  government al  corruption  under the Nationalists.  Chiang Kai-shek  sends in the army to restore order, killing tens of thousands. Some Taiwanese began the  Taiwan independence movement .
  1949:
   Chinese Civil War  between the  Kuomintang  (KMT) party and the  Communist Party of China  (CCP).
  The Nationalists (KMT) lose the war, and escape to the island of Taiwan. They set up  Taipei  as the temporary capital of China (ROC).
  The Communist Party of China (CCP) establishes Beijing as the capital of The  People's Republic of China  (PRC).  
  1951: Japan signs the  Treaty of San Francisco  (1951) with USA.
  1979: The KMT government jails many  democracy  activists who opposed it ( Kaohsiung Incident ).
  1986: The  Democratic Progressive Party  (DPP) is formed; it is the first party to form in the ROC other than the KMT. It remains illegal for several years, but the KMT government does not try to ban it.
  1987: The KMT government lifts the  martial law  after almost 40 years.
  2000:  Chen Shui-bian  (DPP) becomes president.
  2004: Chen Shui-bian is re-elected after a controversial assassination attempt, in which many KMT-supporters believed, was staged by Chen. However, after unwillingness to cooperate about his medical records the investigation was inconclusive.
  2008: Former president Chen Sui-bian and his wife are arrested for corruption and money laundering.
  2008: Ma Ying-jeou was elected as the president of the Republic of China and thus creating a change of political parties for the second time.

  Status of Taiwan  
There are two  China Chinese  governments in the world: The  People's Republic of China  (PRC) and the  Republic of China  (ROC). Today, in reality, the PRC government controls mainland China, and the ROC government governs Taiwan. The ROC government governed most of China mainland from 1911 to 1949, before losing control of China mainland to the PRC.

Today, people who live in Taiwan have different ideas. Although many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China, there are still some Taiwanese who want to be united again with China. The majority of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now.

Today most countries of the world recognize the People's Republic of China as China. Even though Taiwan is not recognized by the UN as a sovereign nation, ref cite web  url http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler   title Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be  author Sigrid Winkler  date June 2012  website   publisher The Brookings Institution  accessdate 26 November 2015 ref  most countries still have close economic and cultural relations with Taiwan. So, both sides are not making any big changes from the political  status quo . This policy was expressed in a 1992  Consensus  among some leaders of both sides.

In  March  2004, China's government passed a law called the Anti- Secession  Law. The law requires the Chinese  military  to  invade  Taiwan immediately if they declare  independence . ref cite web  url http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/12/chinas-new-anti-secession-law-escalates-tensions-in-the-taiwan-strait   title China's New "Anti-Secession Law" Escalates Tensions in the TaiwanStrait  author John J.
