Laboratory techniques

Laboratory techniques  are the techniques of handling the various pieces of apparatus.

 Handling of chemicals 

Ways to dissolve a  solid  in a liquid or to mix two liquids in a  test tube :

  Shake the test tube gently
  Stir with a glass rod

 Heating techniques  

 Hold the material over a naked flame
 Put the material in a water bath
 Use a type of hairdryer called a "heat gun" to blow hot air at the material.

 Collecting gases  
  Upward and downward delivery

  Gas syringe

 Drying substances 

 Leave the mixture at room temperature to evaporate on its own.
 Put the substance in an "oven" which heats it gently and removes water vapour.
