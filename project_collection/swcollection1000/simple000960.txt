  Degree of  br relationship
  Genetic br overlap
  Inbred strain   not applicable  99%
  Identical twins   not applicable   100% ref By replacement in the definition of the notion of "generation" by  meiosis ". Since identical twins are not separated by meiosis, there are no "generations" between them, hence  n =0 and  r =1.
