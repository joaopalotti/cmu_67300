  History  

Nothing is known for sure about the founding of  ancient Rome . The  myth  of  Romulus  and  Remus  is often told. They were supposedly raised by a she- wolf . Romulus killed Remus, and became the first king of Rome, for some time Romulus ruled alongside a Sabine King a neighbouring tribe. There is no historical  evidence  of this, but the story is popular.  Numa Pompilius  was the next king.

With the overthrow of the  Roman Kingdom  began the Republican era. The new  Roman Republic  fought and conquered the people around it. In  390 BC , the town was invaded by  Gauls . Between the third and second century BC, Rome fought against the rival  Carthage . The Roman army captured and destroyed Carthage.

Only with  Julius Caesar  in the first century BC, did the city began to grow significantly, especially toward the Campo Marzio, at the north of  Capitoline Hill Capitol , and its domain was extended to  Britannia . Caesar was never crowned emperor, a title which, however, fell to his adopted son Octavian who took the throne under the name of Augustus.  Augustus  "found a city of bricks and left it of  marble ". Later emperors also added new monuments, temples and triumphal arches to  ancient Rome .

With the decline of the  Roman Empire , the city declined in importance and fell into ruin.  Pope Gregory I  created major reforms for the people. The city was ruled by the  pope , and soon also became the capital of a state, the  Papal States , which remained active until the  19th century nineteenth century .  Popes , like the emperors, became richer over the centuries. The city of monuments and churches was called the "capital of  Christendom ", as the home of the  Basilica  di San Giovanni Lateran, the most important church of the world. The power of the Pope lessened along with its state. On 20 September 1870,  Garibaldi 's army, which had the task of uniting all of Italy under the  House of Savoy crown of Savoy , entered the city through a breach opened in the walls at Porta Pia and, the same year, Rome became the capital of the new Italian state.

 Rome today 

Rome is a major European political and cultural center, containing the  HQ  headquarters  of  FAO . It is home of the pope and was one of the most powerful cities of antiquity (the old world). It currently contains numerous  museum s,  basilica s and  palace s, such as the  Colosseum .
