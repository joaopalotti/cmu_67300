There was very little difference between the two and both were made from 1941 to 1945. They were the most widely produced military vehicle during World War II. American soldiers loved their Jeeps and many wanted to buy one when they returned home. Willys began producing a civilian model called the  Jeep CJ  immediately after the war. These were built from 1946 to 1986. ref Jim Allen,  Jeep Collector's Library  (St. Paul, MN: Motorbooks International, 2004), p. 12 ref

The law required car manufacturers to double fuel economy in the next ten years. ref name Garrett1251  But light trucks (including SUVs) were given lower standards by the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA).

Mark Garrett (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2014), p. 1253 ref  It was gas prices and not safety that caused the manufacturers to make significant changes. The first CUV or crossover vehicle, the  Toyota RAV4  had been sold in the US since 1996. But with higher gas prices CUVs became more popular. They were smaller, lighter and could share engines and chassis designs with existing models. The  Lexus RX  and the  BMW X5  followed along with other models. ref name Garrett1253  In 2006 Ford changed to a unibody CUV chassis for its  Ford Explorer  vehicle.

There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular. One reason is the comfort of their large cabins. Many models can carry almost as much as a minivan. Another reason is the driver still sits higher than other cars and SUVs with truck frames can be among the heavier vehicles on the highway. Their size gives them an image of safety. ref Keith Bradsher,  High and Mighty: The Dangerous Rise of the SUV  (New York: Public Affairs, 2003), p. xiii ref  Men aren't the only targets of SUV and CUV ads. For example, some  Advertising ads  for the  Subaru Forester  are deliberately aimed at women buyers. ref Jack Solomon,  Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers  (Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martins, 2012), p. 61 ref  Roughly 35 to 40 percent of SUV buyers are women. ref Deborah Clarke,  Driving Women: Fiction and Automobile Culture in Twentieth-Century America  (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), p. 103 ref  Ads commonly show SUVs driving across  wikt:boulder boulder s or perched on a  Mountain mountain peak . ref name Kilbourne103 Jean Kilbourne,  Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel  (New York: Touchstone, 1999), p. 103 ref  Advertisers know that one important reason many people buy SUVs is image. ref name Kilbourne103
