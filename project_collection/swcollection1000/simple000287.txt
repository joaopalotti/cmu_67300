  The Month  
 File:Narcissus pseudonarcissus 030405.jpg thumb|180px|right|The  daffodil  is a symbol of the month of March, when  spring  begins in the  Northern Hemisphere . 
In  Roman Empire ancient Rome , March was called Martius. It was named after the war god ( Mars (mythology) Mars ) and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war. Before  Julius Caesar 's  calendar  reform, March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar, as the  winter  was considered to be a monthless period.

March is one of seven months to have 31 days.  March starts on the same day of the week as  November  in all years, and also starts on the same day of the week as  February  in  common year s. Every year, March ends on the same day of the week as  June .

In a  common year , March starts on the same day of the week as  June  and ends on the same day of the week as  September , both of the preceding year; in a  leap year , March starts on the same day of the week as  September  and  December , and ends on the same day of the week as  April  and  December , both of the preceding year.

During years that precede a  common year , March starts on the same day of the week as  August  and ends on the same day of the week as  August  and  November , both of the following year; during years that precede a  leap year , March starts and ends on the same day of the week as  May  of the following year.

In leap years, the day before  March 1  is  February 29 . This determines the position of each day of the year from there on. As an example,  March 1  is usually the 60th day of the year, but in a leap year is the 61st day.

In terms of  season s, March is a month that has an  equinox , with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours, halfway between the  December  and  June   solstice s. In the  Northern Hemisphere ,  spring  starts in this month, while it is  autumn  in the  Southern Hemisphere . The official start of either season is  March 1 , though the  equinox  can fall on  March 20  or  March 21 21 , occasionally on  March 19 . The northern spring equinox marks the start of the  Iran ian  New Year  and  Baha'i   New Year . It is from the  March 21  date that  Easter 's date is calculated, on the Sunday after the first  full moon  in spring, meaning it can fall between  March 22  and  April 25  in Western  Christianity . 

March's flower is the  daffodil  and its  birthstone s are the  bloodstone  and  aquamarine . The meaning of the bloodstone is courage. The star signs for March are  Pisces  ( February 20  to  March 20 ) and  Aries  ( March 21  to  April 20 ).
