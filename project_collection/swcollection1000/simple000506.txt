 Uranus  is the seventh  planet  from the  Sun  in the  Solar System .  It is a  gas giant . It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of  ice ,  gas es and  liquid   metal . Its  atmosphere  contains  hydrogen ,  helium  and  methane . The  temperature  on Uranus is -197 degrees  celsius C  (79 Kelvin K ) near the top of its atmosphere, but its small solid core (about 55% the mass of Earth) is probably about 5,000K.  The planet is  axial tilt tilted  on its  Axis (mathematics) axis  so much that it is sideways. It has five big moons, many small ones, and a small system of  Planetary ring 13 planetary ring s.

The distance between Uranus and the Sun is about 2.8 billion  kilometer km .  Uranus completes its  orbit   around the Sun in 84 earth years. It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes.  This means there are about 43,000 Uranian  day s in one Uranian  year . ref library.thinkquest.org/C005921/Uranus/uranLocOrb.htm ref

Uranus is named after the Greek  Uranos god Uranus , who was a  god  of  sky .

  Exploring  
In 1986,  NASA 's  Voyager 2  visited Uranus. The visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance.

  Clouds  
Uranus is covered in blue clouds. The clouds, made of methane, are difficult to see as they are low in the atmosphere. ref Cite web

  Rings  
 File:Uranian rings scheme.png 100px|left|thumb|The scheme of Uranus's ring-moon system. Solid lines denote rings; dashed lines denote orbits of moons 

The planet  Uranus  has a system made of  13 rings  which is far fewer than the  rings of Saturn  but more than those around  Jupiter  and  Neptune .  The rings of Uranus were discovered in 1977. ref name Elliot1977 cite web title The rings of Uranus author Elliot J.L; Dunham, E. & Mink D. work  Cornell University url http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v267/n5609/abs/267328a0.html year 1977 accessdate June 9, 2007 ref  More than 200 years ago, William Herschel also reported observing rings, but modern astronomers do not believe that he saw them, because they are very dark and faint.

The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young, not more than 600 million years old. The Uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow, optically dense rings only in zones of maximum  stability .

  General properties  
 File:Uranian rings PIA01977.jpg thumb|left|100px|Uranus's inner rings. The bright outer ring is the epsilon ring; eight other rings are visible 

The ring system of Uranus has thirteen distinct rings. In order of increasing distance from the planet they are: 1986U2R/z, 6, 5, 4, a, b, e, g, d, l, e, n, m rings. They can be divided into three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, a, b, e, g, d, e), two dusty rings (1986U2R/z, l) and two outer rings (m, n). The rings of Uranus   consist mainly of macroscopic particles and  little  dust , although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/z, e, d, l, n and m rings. 

In addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007. ref name dePater2007 cite journal last de Pater first Imke coauthors Hammel H B.  et al   title The dark side of the rings of Uranus  journal Science year 2007 volume 317 pages 1888-1890  url http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Sci...317.1888D  doi 10.1126/science.1148103 pmid 17717152 issue 5846 ref  A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering  Ref_label A a none  geometry by  Voyager 2 .  All rings of Uranus show  azimuth al brightness variations.

The rings are made of an extremely dark material. The rings are slightly red in the  ultraviolet  and visible parts of the  spectrum  and grey in  near-infrared . ref name Baines1998 cite journal last Baines first Kevin H.  et al    title Near-Infrared absolute photometric imaging of the Uranian system  journal Icarus year 1998 volume 132  pages 266-284 url http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Icar..132..266B doi 10.1006/icar.1998.5894 ref  They show no identifiable  spectrum analysis spectral features . The  chemical composition  of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the  rings of Saturn  because they are too dark, darker than the  moons of Uranus inner moons of Uranus . This shows that they are probably a mixture of the ice and a dark material.  The nature of this material is not clear, but it may be  organic compound s considerably darkened by the  charged particle  irradiation from the Uranian  magnetosphere . The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons. ref name Baines1998 File:Uranusandrings.jpg thumb|A 1998 false-colour near- infrared  image of Uranus showing  cloud  bands,  planetary ring rings , and  Natural satellite moons  obtained by the  Hubble Space Telescope 's  Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer NICMOS camera 

As a whole, the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty  rings of Jupiter  or the broad and complex  rings of Saturn , some of which are composed of very bright material--water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the e ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of  Saturn (planet) Saturn . Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the  Rings of Neptune Neptunian ring  system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust. The Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.

  Orbit and rotation  
Uranus revolves around the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3  1,000,000,000 (number) billion km (about 20  Astronomical Units AU ). The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1/400 that on Earth. ref cite web title Next Stop Uranus  url http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/04/04.html year 1986 accessdate June 9, 2007 ref  Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by  Pierre-Simon Laplace . ref Forbes, George 1909.  History of Astronomy . ref  With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841,  John Couch Adams  first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845,  Urbain Le Verrier  began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On September 23, 1846,  Johann Gottfried Galle   Discovery of Neptune located a new planet , later named  Neptune , at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier. ref cite web title Mathematical discovery of planets author O'Connor, J J and Robertson, E F url http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html year 1996 accessdate June 13, 2007 ref 

The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes, clockwise ( retrograde motion retrograde ). As on all  giant planet s, its upper atmosphere experiences very strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about two-thirds of the way from the equator to the south pole, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours. ref cite web title Uranus work NASA World Book author Peter J.
