Ad hominem

Ad hominem  is a  Latin language Latin  word for a type of  argument . It is a word often used in  rhetoric . Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your  idea s.

Translated to English,  ad hominem  means  against the person . In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are  attack ing the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.

The term comes from the Latin word  homo , which means  human .  Hominem  is a  gender  neutral version of the word  homo . In ancient  Rome  it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.

Ad hominem can be a way to use  reputation ,  rumor s and  hearsay  to change the minds of other people listening. When a  social network  has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative  label  to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In  court s and in  diplomacy  ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be  Trust (social sciences) trusted , things that they have said previously can be  doubt ed.

  Normal (valid) proof  
  All  human s are mortal
   Socrates  is a man (he is human)
  Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

  Ad hominem example  
  Person A thinks  abortion  should be  illegal 
  Person A is uneducated and poor
  Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.
