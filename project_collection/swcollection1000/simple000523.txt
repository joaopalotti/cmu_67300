Some words have different  pronunciation , for example, 'wind' (the noun) and 'wind' (the verb) are pronounced differently. Some words have different  spelling  for example 'color' and 'colour', which are both correct. Color is used in  American English  and colour is used in  British English . Some words can be only one letter, for example "a" and "I" in  English language English . Besides English, other  language s have their own words.

Words can be invented. This is called  neologism . For example  radar  was originally an  acronym  but became an actual word. 

  Fuller definition  
A word is the smallest thing which can be said  with meaning . This contrasts with a  morpheme , which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example:  oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect ), or several ( rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected ), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just given, these are  -s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed ).

The meaning of a word can be found in a  dictionary .
