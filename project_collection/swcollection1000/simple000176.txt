French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world. ref cite web url http://www.delices-du-monde.fr/recettes-francaise.html title Diversity of French Cuisine accessdate 1 August 2010 fr icon ref 

The roots of modern  haute cuisine  lie in chefs like  Francois Pierre La Varenne La Varenne  (1615-1678) and the notable chef of  Napoleon ,  Marie-Antoine Careme  (1784-1833). These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the  Middle Ages . They used fewer spices, and more  herb s and creamy ingredients.

Typical ingredients like  roux  and fish stock, and techniques such as  marinade marinading , and dishes such as  ragout , were invented. Careme was an expert patissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by  Auguste Escoffier Georges Auguste Escoffier  (1846-1935). He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organised; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of  Le Guide Culinaire  in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the  Savoy Hotel  and  Carlton Hotel  in  London , the  Hotel Ritz Paris , and some of the greatest cruise ships.

Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the  regions of France .

Gastro-tourism and the  Guide Michelin  helped to acquaint people with the rich  bourgeois  and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century.  Gascony Gascon  cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.  Cheese  and  wine  are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally. ref cite web url http://www.goodcooking.com/frcheese.htm title French Cheeses accessdate 1 August 2010 ref ref cite web url http://www.franceway.com/cheese/ title French Cheese accessdate 1 August 2010 ref ref cite web url http://trifter.com/practical-travel/world-cuisine/top-10-most-tasty-cuisines-in-the-world/ title The world's best cuisines accessdate 1 August 2010 ref  In the  north  of France, people often prefer to use  butter  to  wikt:cook cook .

In November 2010,  French gastronomy  was added by  UNESCO  to its lists of the world's 'intangible cultural heritage'. ref http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon appetit: Your meal is certified by the U.N.
