The  sky  is what we call the appearance of a  hemisphere  over our heads. On a clear day it appears  blue .  The deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the horizon, and up to the point above us.

The sky, which is made up of gas  molecule s, is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules.  Rayleigh scattering  defines the amount of scattering of  light  rays. Since all  color s of the  rainbow  create a  white  light we should see a white sky, but blue light scatters much more than  red . That is why the sky appears blue (on a  cloud less day).
