 Hydrogen  is a  chemical element .  Its  atomic number  is 1, which makes it the simplest, known  Chemical element element  in the entire  universe . ref name EIA http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/sources/IntermediateHydrogen.html EIA.doe.gov - What is Hydrogen? ref  Hydrogen is the true primordial substance, the first atom produced after the  big bang . All chemical elements were formed from hydrogen by the processes of  nuclear fusion . ref Carroll, Bradley W. & Ostlie, Dale A. 2006.

  Hydrogen in nature  
In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a  gas . Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a  water  molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the  fuel  that powers the  Sun  and other stars. 
Hydrogen makes up about 74% of the entire  universe .  ref name ut cite web last Cain first Fraser title When was the first light in the universe? url http://phys.org/news/2016-11-universe.html publisher Phys.org accessdate 29 November 2016 author Universe Today date November 7, 2016 ref  Hydrogen's symbol on the  Periodic Table  of Elements is H.

Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen  atoms  connected together. Scientists call these  diatomic   molecules . Hydrogen will have a  chemical reaction  when mixed with most other elements. It has no  color  or  Odor smell . 

Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the  Earth 's  atmosphere . In nature, it is usually in  water .  Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the  organic compounds  that living things are made of.  In addition, hydrogen atoms can combine with  carbon  atoms to form  hydrocarbons .   Petroleum  and other  fossil fuels  are made of these  hydrocarbons  and commonly used to create energy for human use.

Hydrogen has two different  isotopes , called  deuterium  and  tritium . Like regular hydrogen, they both have only one  proton  and one  electron , but deuterium also has one  neutron  and tritium has two. These other types of hydrogen are important in  nuclear energy  and  organic chemistry  reactions. 

Some other facts about hydrogen:
  It is a gas at  room temperature 
  It acts like a  metal  when it is solid.
  It is the lightest element in the  Universe .
  It is the most common element in the Universe. ref name EIA 
  It burns or  explosion explodes  when it touches a  fire flame .

  History of Hydrogen  
Hydrogen was discovered in 1671 by Robert Boyle even though many people think it was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.

  The word  
The name 'Hydrogen' comes from the  Greek language Greek  word for  water , 'udor (pronounced /HEEW-dor/) and gennen meaning to "generate" as it forms water in a  chemical reaction  with oxygen.

  Uses of Hydrogen  
The main uses of hydrogen are in the  petroleum  industry and in making  ammonia  by the  Haber process . Some is used elsewhere in the  chemical  industry. A little of it is used as  fuel , for example in  rocket s for  spacecraft . Most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a  chemical reaction  between  natural gas  and  steam . 

  Nuclear fusion  

 Nuclear fusion  is a very powerful source of  energy . It relies on forcing  atom s together to make  helium  and energy, exactly as happens in a  star  like the  Sun , or in a  hydrogen bomb . This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do yet. A big advantage over  nuclear fission , which is used in today's  nuclear power  stations, is that it makes less nuclear waste and does not use a toxic and rare  fuel  like  uranium .  More than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergo fusion every second on the Sun. ref cite web  url   http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion   title What is Fusion?  first   last   work iter.org  year 2012 [last update]  accessdate 7 March 2012 publisher ITER Organization ref ref cite web url http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html title NASA's Cosmicopia publisher NASA accessdate 28 February 2013 ref 

  Burning Hydrogen  
The  electrolysis of water  easily breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen, using a large amount of electricity.  Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make  steam  (pure water vapor).  A  fuel cell  combines hydrogen with an oxygen  molecule , releasing an electron as electricity.  For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace  technology technologies  such as  diesel-electric   engine s and  biodiesel  fuel.

Some people think it is not correct to see hydrogen as a  fuel  if it is used in a fuel cell.  Because it is not found naturally on Earth, it is more of a replacement for the  power grid .  Such a grid and  infrastructure  with new  vehicle s might be first made in  Iceland , a country that has much free  geothermal energy  and is quite small.  Because it  import s all  fossil fuel , it would help Iceland to completely stop using it. The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell, there is no pollution. Only a small amount of water forms.
