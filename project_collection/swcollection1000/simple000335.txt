This is an unmistakable species, with its generally brown plumage (feathers) and darker head. Its strong toes have much reduced webbing (skin between the toes), an adjustment to the  lava  flows on which it breeds. ref name fifty  The Nene goes about on land much more than other water birds. When moulting (dropping old feathers and growing new ones), the Nene cannot fly, as do other geese, a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting.
