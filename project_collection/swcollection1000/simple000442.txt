Slang

Slang  are words that are   wikt:informal informal .  Usually each  generation  or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people.  On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people.

Over time,  language  tends to get more complex, since new  word s enter much faster than old words leave.  Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all.

It has also happened that some words used in  Anglo-Saxon  for bodily functions became thought of as  profanity  or rude after they were replaced by  Latin ate words like "urinate", "defecate" and "copulate" - which polite people were supposed to use after the  Norman conquest of England  in  1066 .  This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that  etiquette  can develop, and reinforce  power structure .  This is only one example from  history  of how  racism  can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'.

Wanting to have rules of  grammar  that do not change and the same  vocabulary  used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct.

An " idiom " can be slang, but it can also be a  metaphor  that becomes part of the culture.

Two examples of slang are 'wassup' and 'dunnoe'. 'Wassup' usually means 'What is up?' (as in, 'How are you?'), and 'dunnow' usually means 'I don't know'.
