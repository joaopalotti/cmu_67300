Nation

A  nation  is a group of people who share the same  culture ,  history ,  language  or  ethnicity . It can also be described as people living in the same  country  and  government .

The word  nation  comes from a word meaning " birth " or "place of birth." The  adjective  is   national  .

Some nations are people with a particular  belief , such as the  Vatican City , or  ethnic  group, such as  Armenia . Others share an idea, such as  Democracy  in the  United States  or  Communism  in  China . 

Some nations are controlled by a small  minority  who have all the power, such as  Saudi Arabia , who hold the nation together with the use of this power.

Some of these may also be combined. The highest lawful authority of most nations is a  constitution , which is a document which states clearly what kinds of power the rulers have and how new  law s must be made.  Many others are ruled by a single person who holds an "office" (position), such as a  King  or  Pope , or from a long legal tradition without an official Constitution, such as the  United Kingdom .
