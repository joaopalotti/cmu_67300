 Storms and spots 
Saturn's atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds, similar to the clearer spots seen in Jupiter. These oval spots are cyclonic storms, the same as  cyclone s seen on Earth. In 1990, the  Hubble Space Telescope  found a very large white cloud near Saturn's equator. Storms like the one in 1990 were known as  Great White Spot s . These unique storms only exist for a short time and only happen about every 30 Earth years, at the time of the summer  solstice  in the  Northern Hemisphere . ref cite web  url   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505000308   title Saturn's cloud structure and temporal evolution from ten years of Hubble Space Telescope images (1994-2003)  first   last S.

 Planetary rings 

Saturn is best known for its  planetary rings  which are easy to see with a  telescope . There are seven named rings; A, B, C, D, E, F, and G rings. ref name cosmos cite journal  quotes   last Lovett  first Rick  authorlink   coauthors   year 2011  month June/July  title Dance of the rings  journal Cosmos  volume   issue 39  pages 57  id   url http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/   accessdate  2011-06-21 ref  They were named in the order they were discovered, which is different to their order from the planet. From the planet the rings are: D, C, B, A, F, G and E. ref name cosmos rp 57 

Scientists believe that the rings are the material left after a moon broke apart. ref name cosmos rp 60  A new idea says that it was a very large moon, most of which crashed into the planet. This left a large amount of ice to form the rings, and also some of the moons, like Enceladus, which are thought to be made of ice. ref name cosmos rp 61 

 History 
The rings were first discovered by  Galileo Galilei  in 1610, using his telescope. They did not look like rings to Galileo, so he called them "handles". He thought that Saturn was three separate planets that almost touched one another. In 1612, when the rings were facing edge on with the Earth, the rings disappeared, then reappeared again in 1613, further confusing Galileo. ref name history_of_the_rings cite web  url   http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html   title Historical background of Saturn's rings  first Ron  last Baalke  work www2.jpl.nasa.gov  publisher National Aeronautics and Space Administration year 2005   accessdate 2011-07-06 ref  In 1655,  Christiaan Huygens  was the first person to recognise Saturn was surrounded by rings. Using a much more powerful telescope than Galilei's, he noted Saturn "is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching...". ref name history_of_the_rings  In 1675,  Giovanni Domenico Cassini  discovered that the planet's rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps. The largest ring gap was later named the  Rings of Saturn Cassini Division . In 1859,  James Clerk Maxwell  showed that the rings cannot be solid, but are made of small particles, each orbiting Saturn on their own, otherwise, it would become unstable or break apart. ref cite web  url   http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Maxwell_Saturn.html   title James Clerk Maxwell on the nature of Saturn's rings  first James Clerk  last Maxwell  work www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk  year 1859  accessdate 2011-06-19 ref   James Keeler  studied the rings using a  spectrometer spectroscope  in 1895 which proved Maxwell's theory. ref cite web  url http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/HST/Huygens/huygens-introduction.htm   title Christiaan Huygens and his Systema Saturnium  author Brashear, Ronald  date May 1999  publisher   Smithsonian Institution  Libraries accessdate 2011-04-19 ref 

 Physical features 
The rings range from  convert 6630 km mi 0 lk off abbr on  to  convert 120700 km mi 0 lk off abbr on  above the planet's equator. As proved by Maxwell, even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above, the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice. They are only about  convert 10 m ft 0 lk off abbr on  thick; made of  silicon dioxide silica  rock,  iron oxide  and ice particles. ref name cosmos rp 55  The smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house. The C and D rings also seem to have a "wave" in them, like waves in water. ref name cosmos rp 58  These large waves are  convert 500 m ft 0 lk off abbr on  high, but only moving slowly at about  convert 250 m ft 0 lk off abbr on  each day. ref name cosmos rp 58  Some scientists believe that the wave is caused by Saturn's moons. ref cite web  url   http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&Display=Rings   title Saturn: Rings  first   last   work Solar System exploration  publisher National Aeronautics and Space Administration  year 2011-03-22  accessdate 2011-06-19 ref  Another idea is the waves were made by a  comet  hitting Saturn in 1983 or 1984. ref name cosmos rp 60 

The largest gaps in the rings are the Cassini Division and the  Rings of Saturn Encke Division , both visible from the  Earth . The Cassini Division is the largest, measuring  convert 4800 km mi 0 lk off abbr on  wide. ref name Cassini_Division cite web  url   http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level2/cassini_division.html   title StarChild: Saturn's Cassini Division  work The Solar System  publisher  National Aeronautics and Space Administration  year 2011  accessdate 2011-06-19 ref  However, when the Voyager spacecrafts visited Saturn in 1980, they discovered that the rings are a complex structure, made out of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. Scientists believe this is caused by the  gravity gravitational force  of some of Saturn's moons. The tiny moon  Pan (moon) Pan  orbits inside Saturn's rings, creating a gap within the rings. Other ringlets keep their structure due to the gravitational force of  shepherd satellite s, such as  Prometheus (moon) Prometheus  and  Pandora (moon) Pandora . Other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away. The moon  Mimas (moon) Mimas  is responsible for clearing away the Cassini gap. ref name Cassini_Division 

Recent data from the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the rings have their own atmosphere, free from the planet's atmosphere. The rings' atmosphere is made of oxygen gas, and it is produced when the Sun's  ultraviolet  light breaks up the water ice in the rings.  Chemical reaction  also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water  molecule s, creating hydrogen gas.

Saturn was first explored by the  Pioneer 11  spacecraft in September 1979. It flew as close as  convert 20000 km mi 0 lk off abbr on  above the planet's cloud tops. It took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons, but were low in  wikt:resolution resolution  (the quality was not very good). It discovered a new, thin ring called the F ring. It also discovered that the dark ring gaps appear bright when viewed towards the  Sun , which shows the gaps are not empty of material. The spacecraft measured the temperature of the moon Titan. ref cite web  url http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&11.html   title The Pioneer 10 & 11 Spacecraft  archiveurl http://web.archive.org/web/20060130100401/http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&11.html publisher Ames Research Center, NASA  date 2005-10-08   archivedate 2006-01-30  Mission Descriptions.

In November 1980, Voyager 1 visited Saturn, and took higher resolution photographs of the planet, rings and moons. These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 went close to Titan, and gained much information about its atmosphere. In August, 1981,  Voyager 2  continued to study the planet. Photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps.

On July 1, 2004, the Cassini-Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it flew close to  Phoebe (moon) Phoebe , taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its  geyser s. ref cite web  url   http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/09mar_enceladus/   title Radical!
