Inkpad

A  inkpad  is a small  box  which contains a pad of  cloth  or other  material . It is impregnated with ink (the pad is inky). A marker is pressed onto the pad, then onto  paper . Any raised marks on the pad leave an impression in ink on the paper.

Ink pads are used with  rubber stamps . On the stamp is the  symbol  of an organisation, for example. After a form has been passed by an official, it is stamped to show it is authentic. Another variation is a  date stamp , placed on all letters which arrive in the building. Another version is a stamp with a  facsimile  (copy) of an official's  signature . Using this, staff can send out letters when the official is not present. Rubber stamps and ink pads have been used for at least a hundred years by  civil servant s and  business es. They are still in use in many countries, but are gradually being replaced with other systems.
