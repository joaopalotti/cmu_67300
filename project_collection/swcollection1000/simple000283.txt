London was founded by the  Roman Empire Romans  in AD 43 and called  Londinium . London is also known as  Lunnainn  in  Scottish Gaelic language Scottish Gaelic , ref cite web title London in Scottish Gaelic url http://glosbe.com/en/gd/London work Glosbe Dictionary website accessdate 15 April 2014 ref    Llundain  in  Welsh language Welsh  and  Londain  in  Irish language Irish .

For a long time, London was a small city. All its people lived inside the walls that were built by the Romans. This area is still called the  City of London . There were many villages around the city. Gradually, more people came to live there. Then, step by step, the villages joined together into one huge city.

The city has a huge network of  transport  systems. The  Victorian era Victorians  built a number of railway systems in the mid-19th century. Their main stations are in London, and the lines go to every corner of  Great Britain . There were originally five major companies, which were merged into a national rail network in modern times.

There is also the world's first underground railway system,  London Underground , which is the main way  commuter s get into London. There are five  airport s, though only one is actually in London ( London City Airport ). There is the London end of the London ndash Birmingham   canal , which was important to the industrial 19th century.

Most people in London are British. However, London also has many immigrants. These people come from many different countries. They speak many different languages and have different religions and cultures. There are also many people from different countries who stay in London on business. Many people visit London as tourists. They may see the famous "Sights of London". These sights include  palace s,  church es and  museum s.

London is one of the world's most important cities for  business ,  finance , and  politics . It is also important for  culture :  media ,  entertainment ,  fashion , and  art .

  History  
The  Roman Britain Romans  built a city called  Londinium  on the River Thames in AD  43 . The name  Londinium  (and then 'London') came from the  Celtic languages Celtic  language of the  Prehistoric Britain Ancient Britons . In the year AD 61, Queen  Boudica  (a British Celtic queen) and her army destroyed the city. Boudica  Killed in action killed   herself  when Romans trapped her. Then the Romans rebuilt London. London became an important trading city. After the Romans left Britain, few people lived in the city for a long time. This is because the Anglo-Saxons liked living in the countryside. In the  9th century , more people started living there again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England until the  12th century .

After the  railway s were built, London grew very big. Greater London has 33  London Boroughs  and a mayor. The old  City of London  is only a square mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor.

Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster, which was always a different city from the City of London. In Westminster is  Westminster Abbey  (a cathedral), The Palace of Westminster (the  Houses of Parliament , with Big Ben), and  10 Downing Street  (where the  Prime Minister  lives).
