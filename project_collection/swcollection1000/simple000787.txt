 Turkey  ( Turkish language Turkish :  Turkiye ) is a country in both  Europe  and  Asia . The area of Turkey is about 780,000 square kilometres. 

Turkey is a  republic . There are 81 provinces in Turkey. The money of Turkey is called  Turkish Lira .  The capital city is  Ankara , a city in central  Anatolia . The cultural and economic center is  Istanbul , which is in Europe. In the past Istanbul was called  Constantinople .  The republic was founded in 1923, after  World War I  and a war of independence ( Kurtulus Savasi ).  Before that, Turkey was the core of the  Ottoman Empire .  

Many civilizations were located in the area that is now Turkey, like the  Hittites , the  Roman Empire  and the  Byzantine Empire . Many important events in the history of  Christianity  happened in Turkey. Because it lies in both Europe and Asia, some people see Turkey as the "door" between Europe and Asia.

Modern Turkey's warm and varied  climate  lets many kinds of food crops grow, and  livestock  and  forestry  are important industries.  Turkey makes enough  food  to feed itself.  Turkish manufactures include  airplane s,  electronics ,  car s,  clothes clothing  and  textile s for home and for other countries.

Turkey is a popular place for  tourist s to visit. It has hundreds of kilometers of beautiful  beach es on its  Aegean  and  Mediterranean  coasts, and many important historical places.  

  History  
People have been living in  Anatolia  (the Asian part of Turkey - also called  Asia Minor ) longer than almost anywhere else in the world, except Africa. 

The first major empire in the area was the  Hittites  (during the 18th century to the 13th century BC). The Hittites, who spoke one of the  Indo-European languages , developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the  Cimmerians  in the 7th century BC and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia.

From 1950  BCE ,  Ancient Greece Greek s and  Assyrian s inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BC). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until the Assyrian Empire was conquered by  Babylonia  in the year 612 BC. Then  Anatolia  became home for various kingdoms including the  Achaemenid Empire ,  Hellenistic kingdoms ,  Roman Empire ,  Byzantine Empire  (Eastern Roman Empire),  Seljuk Empire , and   Mongol Empire .

During the 14th century, after the fall of the  Mongol Empire , Lord Osman built a new empire named after himself: the  Ottoman Empire . It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the  Balkans , ( Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria ) in   Europe .  The Kingdom was ruled by Muslim law, but other religions had certain  minority rights .

In  World War I  the Ottoman Empire was one of the  Central Powers . During the war, 500,000  Armenians  in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called  Armenian Genocide . Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that  Ataturk  led the army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks.   Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  was the first  President of Turkey .  He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the things he did because they thought they were against  Islam . Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example.

For many years  Kurdish people Kurdish   guerrilla s (usually called the "PKK") led by  Abdullah Ocalan  have been fighting the Turkish government. They said they were fighting so that the  Kurd s in the south east of Turkey could have  autonomy  and decide more things for themselves. But the government and most countries in the world call them  terrorist s.

On 15 July 2016, a  coup d'etat  was  2016 Turkish coup d'etat attempt attempted .

  People  
 File:Yagli gures1.jpg thumb|Oil-wrestling at Kirkpinar 
About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are  ethnic   Turkish people Turks . About 15% are ethnic  Kurd s. Many  refugee s from  Syria  (over 2 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the  Syrian civil war .

The vast majority of Turks are  Muslim . The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. 

Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as  manti  (Turkish  ravioli ),  doner ,  kebab s, Turkish delight, baklava, borek, kofte, and other foods.

Much of the population in Turkey is made up of  teenager s and young adults. 

According to a study, Anatolia is  genetics genetically  more closely related to the  Balkans Balkan  populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of  Anatolia  (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from  Central Asia . ref Cite web url    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18161848 title   Alu insertion polymorphisms and an assessment of the genetic contribution of Central Asia to Anatolia with respect to the Balkans. first    last    date   2008 May website    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov publisher   Berkman CC1, Dinc H, Sekeryapan C, Togan I, accessdate    ref  The population is mainly from the  Greeks ,  Armenians  and  Kurds .

  European Union  
Turkey is trying to join the  European Union European Union (EU) . The EU says that before Turkey can join, it must start trading with the  Republic of Cyprus  and improve  human rights .

  Economy  
Turkey is in the  OECD  and the  G-20 , and is one of the 20 richest countries.  The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.

In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for their summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey.

Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Ozal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property.  Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit.

Turkey mostly buys and sells with the  EU , the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey. 

Turkey's  export s in 2010 were worth 117 billion  United States dollar s. 

Turkey has no  petroleum  or  natural gas  so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Northern Turkish Cyprus.

  Provinces

The largest and the most crowded city is  Istanbul  which is the only city in the world that has land on two different continents. The third largest city is the coastal city of  Izmir Izmir  which is the main port of the country. Turkey is divided into 81  province s. Each province has its own little government but they can only make decisions about small things: the government in Ankara decides important issues. The provinces are in 7 regions. Each province is divided into districts. There are 923 districts altogether.
