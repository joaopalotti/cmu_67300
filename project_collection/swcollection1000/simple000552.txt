Modern zoos try not only to be for people's  entertainment , but for  education ,  research , and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of  extinction dying out .
These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are  health y and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo.

In order to help thoroughly educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world, it is crucial that zoos receive the proper funding necessary.  Proper funds allow the process of people and wildlife successfully coexisting to be able to continue. With the ability to pursue continuing research and education for people about the world around them, preservation of crucial natural resources is made more of a reality. Funds also work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care. 

In the past, but also today, there are a lot of zoos that are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in very bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick.
