A  university  is an institution where teaching and research is done. The word  university  comes from the  Latin   universitas magistrorum et scholarium , roughly meaning "community of teachers and  academia scholars ."  ref http://books.google.com/books?id=5vgGE8_CGOEC&pg=PA748&lpg=PA748&dq=community+of+teachers+and+scholars+universitas+magistrorum+et+scholarium&source=web&ots=Q-K88OdXyH&sig=YqFluZHNcSWstv1oApgs34cMUdQ Google eBook of  Encyclopedia Britannica ref  People can attend university to get a degree. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialized. A person studying  biology  at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields, like languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research.

  History  
 File:Bologna-vista02.jpg thumb|Area above the old  University of Bologna  buildings, founded in 1088 
The universities were born in Europe during the  Middle Ages . The first institution of this type was the  University of Bologna  that later became a model for similar centers of education. ref Hunt Janin: "The university in medieval life, 1179-1499", McFarland, 2008, ISBN 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f. ref ref de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde:  http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&printsec=frontcover A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages , Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47-55 ref ref cite book   url http://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC title The Challenge of Bologna  author Paul L. Gaston   year 2010   pages 18   isbn 1-57922-366-4 ref  This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought, although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages.

At first, the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages, they remained tied to the  Catholic Church . At the beginning, they had worked to teach the so-called "seven  liberal arts " (the  trivium  and the  quadrivium ):
   Trivium :  grammar ,  logic  and  rhetoric .
   Quadrivium :  arithmetic  and  geometry ,  astronomy  and  music .
That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields. The world's oldest university is  Qarawiyyin university .

  Organization  
A university can include several  campus es, or different places where classes are taught. In each campus there are several  faculty faculties  and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms, and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree.
The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body.
