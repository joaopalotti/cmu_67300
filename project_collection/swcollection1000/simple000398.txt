Physiology

Physiology  is the study of how  Life living things  work. Physiologists can study how  Organ (anatomy) organs  of an  organism  work together to make things happen. In  human being s, for example, the  digestion  of  food   hormone s and other  chemical s are made by the  stomach ,  liver , and  pancreas .  Muscle  contraction happens because of chemical messages made by  nerve s of that muscle. By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and  physician s can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally. For example, an understanding of how the  thyroid gland  functions has helped in treating  goitre . Studies of the  circulatory system  and the  nervous system  have helped physicians understand and treat such  illness es like  heart disease ,  Stroke (medicine) stroke , and  high blood pressure .
