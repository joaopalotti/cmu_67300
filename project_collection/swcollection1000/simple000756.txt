A  radio telescope  is like a huge  satellite   dish . An ordinary  telescope  allows people to see light from distant objects. Stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope, but they also give off  radio wave s.  Scientist s with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use  computer s to learn about the stars. Other things like  black hole s also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too.

The dish is sometimes constructed of a  conductive  wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes, so even very faint signals can be received. Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes.

The radio telescope at the  Parkes Observatory ,  Parkes, New South Wales  was used by  NASA  to receive messages from the  Apollo 11  moon landings.
