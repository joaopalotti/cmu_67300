  Stadium  
Fulham's stadium is called " Craven Cottage ", it was built 100 years ago. It has a pretty building in one corner of the pitch, this is the "Cottage". The fans of Fulham like to call it "The Cottage", and it can have 26,500 people sitting in it.

From 2002 to 2004, Fulham had to play at Loftus Road, which is the ground of  Queens Park Rangers F.C. Queens Park Rangers , near the  BBC . This was because the club needed to change Craven Cottage because of new rules. The rules said that nobody can stand at football games, so the club had to have new seats.

Some people who live near to Craven Cottage do not like having a big club near to them. They made it hard for the club to be allowed to make the changes. This is why the changes took a long time, even though it was easy work for the builders.

Because of the "Cottage", the club and its supporters are called "The Cottagers".

  Now  
The club plays in the  English Premier League Premier League , the top football league in England. The club is managed by Felix Magart who preceded Martin Jol and Rene Mulensteen (after Roy Hodgeson)
