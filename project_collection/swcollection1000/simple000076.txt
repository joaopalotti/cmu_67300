 Cartography  is making  map s. It is part of  geography .
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using  computer s. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.

General maps are produced in a series. Governments produce them in larger-scale and smaller-scale maps of great detail.
