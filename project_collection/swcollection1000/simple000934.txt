The  International System of Units  is the standard modern form of the  metric system . The name of this system can be shortened or  abbreviation abbreviated  to  SI , from the  French language French  name  S ysteme  I nternational d'unites .

The International System of Units is a  system of measurement  based on 7 base units: the  metre  (length),  kilogram  (mass),  second  (time),  ampere  (electric current),  Kelvin  (temperature),  mole (unit) mole  (quantity), and  candela  (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates  SI derived units , which can be used to describe other quantities, such as  volume ,  energy ,  pressure , and  velocity .

The system is used almost globally. Only  Myanmar ,  Liberia , and the  United States  do not use SI as their official system of measurement. ref name ciawf cite web  title Appendix G: Weights and Measures  url https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html   work The World Facebook  publisher Central Intelligence Agency   date 2013  accessdate 5 April 2013 ref  In these countries, though, SI is commonly used in science and medicine.

  History and use  
The  metric system  was created in  France  after the  French Revolution  in  1789 . The original system only had two standard units, the kilogram and the metre. The metric system became popular amongst scientists.

In the  1860s ,  James Clerk Maxwell  and  William Thomson  (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units - length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the  centimetre-gram-second system of units  (CGS), which used the  centimetre  as the base unit for length, the  gram  as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the  dyne  as the base unit for  force  and the  erg  as the base unit for energy.

As scientists studied  electricity  and  magnetism , they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the  20th century , many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing.

In  1954 , the 9th  CGPM General Conference on Weights and Measures  (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, and candela. ref name 9cgpm citation  url http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/10/6/   author   International Bureau of Weights and Measures   title Systeme pratique d'unites de mesure (Practical system of units)  year 1954 . 9 sup th sup  session, Resolution 6. ref  The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in  1971 . ref name 14cgpm citation  url http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/14/3/   author  International Bureau of Weights and Measures  title Unite SI de quantite de matiere (SI unit of amount of substance)  year 1971 . 14 sup th sup  session, Resolution 3. ref 

SI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the  United States ,  Liberia  and  Myanmar , where the older  imperial unit s are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the  British Empire , are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time.

  Units of measurement   

  Base units  

The SI  base units  are  measurement s used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called "derived units".

  Derived units  
Derived units are created by combining the base units. The base units can be divided, multiplied, or raised to  exponent powers . Some derived units have special names. Usually these were created to make calculations simpler.

  Prefixes  
 
Very large or very small measurements can be written using  prefix es. Prefixes are added to the beginning of the unit to make a new unit. For example, the prefix  kilo-  means "1000" times the original unit and the prefix  milli-  means "0.001" times the original unit. So one  kilometre  is 1000 metres and one  milligram  is a 1000th of a  gram .
