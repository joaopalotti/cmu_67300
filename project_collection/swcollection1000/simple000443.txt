Social contract

A  social contract  is an  agreement  between the  people  of a state and the government of a state.  The people agree to follow certain rules made by the government. These rules are usually called  law s. Laws help to make sure people have  rights  and that their rights are taken care of. One kind of social contract is a  constitution . A constitution sets limits on the  Influence powers  of  government   leaders ,  police , and other people who have  authority .

The first social contracts were written by  philosopher s such as  John Locke  and  Jean-Jacques Rousseau .  They saw good government as coming from social contracts.  Rousseau wrote a book called  The Social Contract .  Both the  United States Declaration of Independence  and  United States Constitution  are social contracts.
