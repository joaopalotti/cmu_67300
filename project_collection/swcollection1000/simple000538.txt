 Water  is the most common  liquid  on  Earth .

If water gets very cold (below 0 degrees  Celsius ), it  freeze s and becomes  ice .  If water gets very hot (above 100 degrees  Celsius ), it  Boiling boils  and becomes  steam . Water is very important for life. ref cite web url http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html   title United Nations  publisher Un.org  date 2005-03-22  accessdate 2010-07-25 ref  However, some studies suggest that by 2025 more than half the people around the world will not have enough water. ref cite journal author   Kulshreshtha S.N. 1998  title   A global outlook for water resources to the Year 2025 journal   Water Resources Management volume   12 issue   3 pages   167-184 accessdate   2008-06-09 doi   10.1023/A:1007957229865 ref

Water is a  molecule  made of 2  hydrogen   atom s and 1  oxygen  atom. Its  chemical formula  is H sub 2 sub O.
Like other liquids, water has a  surface tension , so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface. ref cite web  url https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/liquids-and-solids-11/liquid-properties-85/surface-tension-376-6402/   title Surface tension is a contractive tendency of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force. author   date   website   publisher Boundless  accessdate December 25, 2016 ref  Water can also be called 'aqua', which is the  Ancient Rome Roman  word for water.

  Uses of water  
 Plant s and  animal s (including  wikt:people people ) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a  Media medium  for  chemical reaction s to take place, and is the main part of  blood plasma blood . It keeps the body  temperature  the same by  sweat ing from the  skin .  Water helps blood carry  nutrient s from the  stomach  to all parts of the body to keep the body alive.  Water also helps the blood carry  oxygen  from the  lung s to the body.   Saliva , which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make  urine . Urine helps remove bad  chemical s from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water.

Water is the main component of  drink s like  milk ,  juice , and  wine . Each type of drink also has other things that add  flavor  or  nutrient s, things like  sugar ,  fruit , and sometimes  alcohol . Water that a person can drink is called "potable water" (or "drinking water"). The water in oceans is  salt water , but lakes and rivers usually have  fresh water unsalted water . Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water. ref cite web url http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html title Percentage of water ref ref cite web url http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/water.htm title Fresh water percentage (2) ref 

Many places, including cities and  desert s, don't have as much water as people want. They build  aqueduct s to bring water there.

Though a human being can survive for up to a three weeks without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few  desert  animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink.
