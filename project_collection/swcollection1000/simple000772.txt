Fluid ounce

A  fluid ounce  is a unit of  volume  in both the  Imperial unit imperial system of units  and the  U.S. customary units  system. However, the two measures are not quite the same:
  The Imperial fluid ounce is (1/160) of an imperial  gallon  or 8  fluidram fluid drams , about 1.734  cubic inch es or exactly 28.413 07425 mL (as specified legally in  http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951804_en_2.htm The Units of Measurement Regulations 1995 ). This volume of  water  weighs very nearly 1 avoirdupois  ounce .
  The U.S. fluid ounce is (1/128) of a U.S. fluid gallon, about 1.805 cubic inches or exactly 29.573 529 562 5 mL. This volume of water weighs about 1.04  avoirdupois  ounces.
  U.S. law 21CFR101.9(b)(5)(viii) also defines a fluid ounce of exactly 30 mL, for use in nutrition labeling.
