 Mainland China  is the part of  China  not including the Republic of China controlling  Taiwan ,  Kinmen ,  Matsu , and the  Pescadores .  The term also excludes  Hong Kong  and  Macau . 

In the  Qing Dynasty , all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and  Mongolia  were part of the Chinese Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were given to foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the  UK British , and Macau to the  Portugal Portuguese ).

By the end the Qing Empire, China became  Kuomintang Nationalist  China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the  Communist s (the  People's Republic of China ) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores.  Mongolia became an  independence independent  state later.

Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the  continent  (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is  Hainan ). This region is Mainland China.

Later Hong Kong and Macau were returned to the government of China, but because the government calls them " special administrative regions " under a "one country, two systems" idea, they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China.
