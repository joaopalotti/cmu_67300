A  number  is a  concept  from  mathematics , used to  counting count  or  measurement measure . Depending on the field of mathematics, where numbers are used, there are different definitions:
  People use  symbol s to represent numbers; they call them  numeral s. Common places where numerals are used are for labeling, as in  telephone number s, for ordering, as in  serial number s, or to put a unique identifier, as in an  ISBN , a unique number that can identify a  book .
   Cardinal number s are used to measure how many items are in a  set . {A,B,C} has size "3".
   Ordinal number s are used to specify a certain element in a  set  or  sequence  ( first ,  second ,  third ).

Numbers are also used for other things besides counting. Numbers are used when things are  measure d. Numbers are used to study how the world works.  Mathematics  is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things. The study of the rules of the natural world is called  science . The work that uses numbers to make things is called  engineering .

  Numbering methods  
  Numbers for people  
There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers. These methods are called number systems. The most common number system that people use is the  base ten  number system. The  base ten  number system is also called the  decimal  number system. The base ten number system is common because people have ten  finger s and ten  toe s. There are 10 different symbols {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9} used in the base ten number system. These ten symbols are called digits. ref A finger or a toe is also called a digit. ref 

A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits. The position of the digits shows how big the number is. For example, the number 23 in the decimal number system really means (2 times 10) plus 3, and 101 means 1 times a hundred (=100) plus 0 times 10 (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1).

  Numbers for  machine s  
Another number system is more common for machines. The machine number system is called the  binary  number system. The binary number system is also called the base two number system. There are two different symbols (0 and 1) used in the base two number system. These two symbols are called bits. ref A bit is a short form of the words "binary digit". ref 

A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols. The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 means 1 times four (=4) plus 0 times two (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2. The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5.

  Names of numbers  
 seealso Names of numbers in English 
English has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are " Exponentiation powers  of ten". All of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol "1" and the symbol "0". For example, ten tens is the same as ten times ten, or one hundred. In symbols, this is "10 x 10 = 100". Also, ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred, or one thousand. In symbols, this is "10 x 100 = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000". Some other power of ten numbers also have special names:

   1 (number) 1  - one
   10 (number) 10  - ten
  100 - one  hundred 
  1000 - one  thousand 
   1,000,000  - one  million 

When dealing with larger numbers than this, there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English. Under the "long scale" a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number. It is also called the "British Standard". This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English-speaking countries today. It is still used in some other European nations. Another scale is the "short scale" under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number. This scale is a lot more common in most English-speaking nations today.

  1,000,000,000 - one  billion  (short scale), one  milliard  (long scale)
  1,000,000,000,000 - one  trillion  (short scale), one  billion  (long scale)
  1,000,000,000,000,000 - one  quadrillion  (short scale), one  names for large numbers billiard  (long scale)

  Types of numbers  
  Natural numbers  
 Natural number s  are the numbers which we normally use for counting, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. Some people say that 0 is a natural number, too.

Another name for these numbers is  positive numbers . These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers. But not all positive numbers are natural (for example  math \frac{1}{2} math  is positive, but not natural).

If 0 is called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers. If 0 is not called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers. So if the words "natural numbers" are not used, then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not. But unfortunately, some say that zero is not a whole number, either, and some say whole numbers can be negative. "Positive integers" and "non-negative integers" are another way to include zero or exclude zero, but only if people know those words.

  Negative numbers  
 Negative number s  are numbers less than zero.

One way to think of negative numbers is using a  number line . We call one point on this line zero. Then we will label (write the name of) every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is, for example the point one is one centimeter to the right, the point two is two centimeters to the right.

Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point. We cannot call this point one, as there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus 1 (-1) (as it is one centimeter away, but in the opposite direction).

A drawing of a number line is below.

All the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers:

If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 + (-3) is the same as 5 - 3, and equals 2.

If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 - (-3) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8.

If they  multiplication multiply  two negative numbers together they get a positive number. For example, -5 times -3 is 15.

If they multiply a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, they get a negative result. For example, 5 times -3 is -15.

As finding the square root of a negative number is impossible as negative times negative equals possitve. We simbolise the square root of a negative number as i.

  Integers  
 Integer s  are all the natural numbers, all their  opposite number opposites , and the number  zero .  Decimal Decimal numbers  and fractions are not integers.

  Rational numbers  
 Rational number s  are numbers which can be written as  fraction (mathematics) fractions . This means that they can be written as  a  divided by  b , where the numbers  a  and  b  are integers, and  b  is not equal to 0.

Some rational numbers, such as 1/10, need a  finite  number of digits after the  decimal point  to write them in  decimal  form. The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1. Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational. Some rational numbers, such as 1/11, need an  Infinity infinite  number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point. The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as  0.0909090909  ... .

A  percentage  could be called a rational number, because a percentage like 7% can be written as the fraction 7/100. It can also be written as the decimal 0.07. Sometimes, a  ratio  is considered as a rational number.

  Irrational numbers  
 Irrational numbers  are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction, but do not have  imaginary numbers imaginary  parts (explained later).

Irrational numbers often occur in  geometry . For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the  square root  of two, which equals 1.414213 ... . This is an irrational number. Mathematicians have  mathematical proof proved  that the  square root  of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.

One well-known irrational number is  Pi (mathematical constant) pi . This is the  circumference  (distance around) of a circle divided by its  diameter  (distance across). This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926535 ... .

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in  decimal  form. It would have an  Infinity infinite  number of digits after the decimal point. Unlike 0.333333 ..., these digits would not repeat forever.

  Real numbers  
 Real number s  is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above:
  The rational numbers, including integers
  The irrational numbers
This is all numbers that do not involve  Number#Imaginary numbers imaginary numbers .

  Imaginary numbers  
 Imaginary number s  are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number  i . This number is the  square root  of minus one (-1).

There is no number in the real numbers which when  squared  makes the number -1. Therefore, mathematicians invented a number. They called this number  i , or the  imaginary unit .

Imaginary numbers operate under the same rules as real numbers:
  The sum of two imaginary numbers is found by pulling out (factoring out) the  i . For example, 2 i  + 3 i  = (2 + 3) i  = 5 i .
  The difference of two imaginary numbers is found similarly.  For example, 5 i  - 3 i  = (5 - 3) i  = 2 i .
  When multiplying two imaginary numbers, remember that  i  x  i  (i sup 2 sup ) is -1.  For example, 5 i  x 3 i  = ( 5 x 3 ) x (  i  x  i  ) = 15 x (-1) = -15.

Imaginary numbers were called  imaginary  because when they were first found, many mathematicians did not think they existed. Fact date April 2009  The person who  discovered  imaginary numbers was  Gerolamo Cardano  in the 1500s. The first to use the words  imaginary number  was  Rene Descartes . The first people to use these numbers were  Leonard Euler  and  Carl Friedrich Gauss . Both lived in the  18th century .

  Complex numbers  
 Complex number s  are numbers which have two parts; a  real  part and an  imaginary  part. Every type of number written above is also a complex number.

Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers. The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane. This is composed of a real number line, and an imaginary number line.

All of normal mathematics can be done with complex numbers:
  To add two complex numbers, add the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, (2 + 3 i ) + (3 + 2 i )  = (2 + 3) + (3 + 2) i = 5 + 5 i .
  To subtract one complex number from another, subtract the real and imaginary parts separately.  For example, (7 + 5 i ) - (3 + 3 i ) = (7 - 3) + (5 - 3) i  = 4 + 2 i .

To multiply two complex numbers is complicated. It is easiest to describe in general terms, with two complex numbers a + b i  and c + d i .

 math ( a + b \mathrm{i} ) \times ( c + d\mathrm{i} ) = a \times c + a \times d\mathrm{i} + b\mathrm{i} \times c + b\mathrm{i} \times d\mathrm{i} = ac + ad\mathrm{i} + bc\mathrm{i} -bd = ( ac - bd ) + ( ad + bc )\mathrm{i} math 

For example, (4 + 5 i ) x (3 + 2 i ) = (4 x 3 - 5 x 2) + (4 x 2 + 5 x 3) i  = (12 - 10) + (8 + 15) i  = 2 + 23 i .

  Transcendental numbers  
A real or complex number is called a  transcendental number  if it can  not  be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients.

 math  a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0  math 

Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult. Each transcendental number is also an irrational number. The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz  and  Leonhard Euler . The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was  Joseph Liouville . He did this in  1844 .

Well-known transcendental numbers:
   E (mathematical constant) e 
   Pi (mathematical constant) p 
  e sup a sup  for algebraic a  tt [?] tt  0
   math 2^{\sqrt{2}} math
