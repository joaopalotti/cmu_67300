Regime

A  regime  is the  leader  and other people who run a  government  of a  sovereign state .

There are many kinds of regimes.  They can achieve  Influence power  in many ways.  Depending on the time and place and local  civics  like the  electoral system , they can lose power in many ways too.  The most common way for a regime to lose power was a  coup ,  invasion  or  revolution  until the  20th century .  After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods.  Peaceful regime change is usually by an  election  - this method is now used by more than half the people on the  Earth .  It is called  representative democracy .  Such regimes are often called  administration s to make it clear they are not  dictator s, and since the  executive branch  does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a  legislative branch .  Also the  judicial branch  is separate.  The  court s are not usually considered part of the regime.

However, some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power:

 The regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power - these may be in the  military  or a  political party .
 Military and  police  obey the regime's orders, and can kill people.  If they would not do so, then, it would be possible to change regimes by force.
 Trade  and  tax  is set by the regime, which can take  money  away.
 The regime speaks for the whole country when dealing with other countries.

When many regimes negotiate at the  United Nations  or  World Trade Organization , it does not matter at all how each regime got its power.  It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says.

When someone wants a regime to change in another country, they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its  election .  This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime.
