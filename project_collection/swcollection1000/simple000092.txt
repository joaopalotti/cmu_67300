Census of Marine Life

The  Census of Marine Life  is a ten-year survey of  life  in the  ocean s, starting in  2000 . Its head is  Ron O'Dor  of  Dalhousie University  in  Halifax Regional Municipality Halifax, Nova Scotia , Canada. It uses data from researchers all over the world. More than 70  nation s are involved and over a  billion   United States dollar US dollars  will be spent on it.

It is a major work of  marine ecology .

It is trying to do what the  World Wide Fund for Nature  (WWF) and  National Geographic Society  did for  terrestrial ecoregion s - say exactly what is alive on the planet.

In this case, in the seas.
