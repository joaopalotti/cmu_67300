Time limit

A  time limit  is a  time horizon  that is imposed on everyone at once. 

It may be used to try to achieve  fairness  in some system of  ethics .  For instance, if poor people and rich people are debating something, a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work, and lose.

Time limits are very important in  accounting  so that everyone can report their results (for  tax  and  investment   wikt:purpose purposes ) at the same time.  This in turn creates  deadline s for the  accountant  and those reporting.

However, the deadline is imposed by an  authority , whereas the time limit is imposed by a system.  So there can be  slack  in a deadline, so that results do not have to be reported always very fast.

For example, in the  United States United States of America , the  end of the calendar year  on  December 31  is the time limit for taxes, but the  deadline  for reporting is  April 15 .  Sometimes the government allows more time, as it did for the families of those who were killed in the  September 11, 2001 attacks .
