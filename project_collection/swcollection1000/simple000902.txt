  History  
 File:Evertonteam1891b.jpg thumb|left|200px|The league winning Everton team of 1891  Everton started out in 1878 with the name  St Domingo's FC . At first it was only for people who went to St Domingo's  church , but so many people were interested they let people from the local are join as well. ref citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html title Everton-history ref  A year later the club was renamed Everton Football Club, after the area. ref name toffeeweb1 citeweb url http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1878-1888.asp title A concise toffee history ref  Everton Football Club's first ever match was against a team called St Peter's in 1879. Everton won 6-0. ref name toffeeweb1 

Everton entered the  FA Cup  in the 1886/87 season. They were beaten 1-0 by  Rangers F.C. Rangers  in the first round. As football became more and more popular around England, the clubs realised they needed an organised league. In 1888 the Football League was founded. Everton were one of the 12 founding members.  Preston North End F.C. Preston North End  won the first two leagues and Everton won the third in 1891. They won their second ever trophy, the  FA Cup , in 1905 but did not win another until 1916. It was not until 1927 that Everton had their first period of long success. In 1925 they signed  Dixie Dean  and in 1927 he scored 60 goals in 39 games, setting a new world record and taking Everton to another league title. ref citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html?page=6 title William Ralph Dean - an Everton legend ref  Everton were relegated, or sent down, to a the second division in 1930/1931. Within a year they were promoted again, and the club has not been relegated again since. This makes them the English football team with the most  wikt:consecutive consecutive  seasons in the top league of English football ref . citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/the-dixie-years.html?page=2 title Everton a history - 1931 1959 ref  

Everton's second successful period came after 1961 when  Harry Catterick  was given the job of manager. With Catterick in charge Everton won two league titles and four cups between 1961 and 1970. This success did not last however, and after three years of low league finishes Catterick quit his job. The club finished in middle of the table, or mid-table, positions for the rest of the 1970's with a line of unsuccessful managers. In 1981 the club appointed  Howard Kendall  to be the new manager. He turned Everton around and eventually became the most successful manager in the clubs history, winning two league titles and three cups between 1981 and 1987. ref citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html title Everton - A history -1981 to present ref  This era also brought Everton's one and only European trophy win, the Cup Winners Cup in 1985. The semi final saw Everton beat  Germany German  champions  F.C. Bayern Munich Bayern Munich  3-1, a match voted the greatest of all time at Goodison Park. ref citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/goodison-s-greatest-night.html title Goodison's Greatest Night ref  The final saw another 3-1 win for Everton against Rapid Vienna, crowning them  European Cup Winners Cup Champions; their first and only European title to date.

In 1985 several  Liverpool F.C. Liverpool  and 39  Juventus F.C.

Because of this all English clubs were not allowed to play against European teams untl 1991. This denied Everton the chance to defend their European title and the team gradually broke up, selling many of their best players to other European clubs. The club did not do very well in the early 90s, nearly getting relegated twice and going through lots of money problems. However they still became one of the first members of the new  English Premier League  when it started in 1992. They were quite successful under a manager called  Joe Royle ,who took over in 1994. In his second season in charge he kept Everton clear of relegation and won the FA cup, the club's first trophy in seven years. The club had steady improvement under Royle, finishing 6th and 7th in the 1996 and 1997 seasons. ref citeweb url http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html title Everton: A History - Kendall's heroes retrievaldate 03.11.09 ref  

After two seasons however the club's performance went downhill and Kendall was sacked after only narrowly avoiding relegation in the 1998/99 season. Former player  Walter Smith  took over for three seasons, but failed to perform, spending a lot of money but not getting the team to good league positions.  David Moyes  took over in 2002 and has been one of the club's most successful managers to date. Under his management the club has become a regular top 10 side, finishing 4th in 2005, their highest ever Premier League finish. 

Under his management  Wayne Rooney  was brought into the first team and he was quickly sold to  Manchester United  for PS27 million, a club record fee. ref citeweb url http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3616874.stm title Manchester United explain Rooney deal. ref  
Since 2005 Everton have enjoyed regular top 8 finishes and reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup in 2007 and the FA Cup final in 2009.

  Kit  
Everton usually wear  dark blue royal blue  shirts with white shorts and blue socks. 

They wore many different kit colours in their first few years. At first they wore white shorts and white shirts with blue stripes. However many players who moved to Everton still wore the shirts of their old team, so things quickly got confusing. To solve this the club introduced an all black kit to the club, as black  dye  was cheap and easily available. ref name Toffeeweb2 citeweb url http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/concise/1888-1915.asp title Toffeeweb- An Everton History retrievaldate 04.11.09 ref  However many fans thought this was quite boring and slightly  broken wikt link morbid morbid  so a red band was added across the chest. ref name Toffeeweb2 
It was not until the 1901/02 season that the colours of royal blue and white were first introduced. This kit has stayed, with a few small changes, almost exactly the same from then until the present day. ref name toffeekit citeweb url http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#Toffees title Everton - Club Colours ref  It was changed for one year in 1986, to  light blue , but the fans did not like this at all and it was quickly changed back again. ref name toffeekit 

  Sponsors  
Everton's current shirt  sponsor  is a  beer  maker from  Thailand ,  Chang Beer . Previous shirt sponsors have included  electronic s company  NEC  and food maker  Danka . Everton were the first Premier League team to take off shirt sponsors from their child shirts because they did not like advertising  alcohol  to children. ref citeweb url http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/everton/article4076141.ece title Everton sober up for sake of their young fans - The Times online retrievaldate 03.11.09 ref 

  Nickname and traditions  
Everton's  wikt:nickname nickname  is the  Toffees , or sometimes the  Toffeemen . This comes from one of two  toffee  shops that were near their stadium at the time the club started. ref name Toffees1 citeweb url http://www.toffeeweb.com/club/folklore/origins.asp#Toffees title The Toffees - what sort of a nickname is that? ref  Both Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House and Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop claim to have started off the nickname. ref name Toffees1  At first Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House was very popular with fans because it was near to their stadium. However when the club moved to Goodison Park, they became close to Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop. There they sold  candy sweets  called 'Everton mints', which proved even more popular. Faced with going out of business, Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House got a licence to throw free toffees to the crowd inside the ground, before the match. ref name Toffees1  This tradition continues even today. A teenage girl is chosen from the crowd to throw toffees to the crowd before the match, at half time and after the match. ref name Toffees1 

At other times in their history Everton have also been known as 'The Black Watch', 'The Blues' and, in the 1980's, 'The School of Science'. ref name BBC citeweb url http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882885 title BBC Guide to Everything - Everton Football Club ref 

Like many Premier League football clubs, Everton's players walk out onto the pitch to a particular song at the beginning of every match. With Everton it is the theme tune to a 1960's  television  series called  Z-Cars . ref name BBC  Z-Cars was about  police  working in a made up town, which many people believed was based on real life  Liverpool . ref citeweb url http://www.freebase.com/view/en/z-cars title Z-Cars, some facts and discussion ref
