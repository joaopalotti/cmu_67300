 Logo 
In 2006, there was a vote for the change of the logo of Wiktionary. The original logo of only words was replaced. However, there were very few people who voted in this contest. Therefore, smaller wikis used the newer logo but the  English language English  Wiktionary stayed the same logo.

In 2009, there was a second contest for a newer logo  (pictured) . This was a step to make all the  Wiktionaries  to have the same logo on all projects. However, the English Wiktionary still did not use the new  logo . The Simple English Wiktionary voted on the new logo on November 30, 2010 and the community decided the new logo to become their logo. ref http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Simple_talk/Archive_15#New_Wiktionary_logo New Wiktionary Logo vote - Simple English Wiktionary  - Retrieved April 20, 2011 ref  However, no changes were made to the logo and the discussion was thus forgotten.
