"London" now refers to  Greater London , which is made up of 32  borough s (including the  City of Westminster  and the City of London. The City is in central  London  and is the oldest part of the city, dating back to  Ancient Rome Roman  times. The City of London has its own mayor, the  Lord Mayor of London , an office separate from (and much older than) the  Mayor of London . There are other ancient features, dating back to  Middle Ages medieval  times. The City has its own police force, the  City of London Police .

  Financial markets  
The City vies with  New York City  as the financial capital of the world: many banking and insurance institutions have their headquarters there. The  London Stock Exchange  ( shares  and  Bond (finance) bonds ),   Lloyd's of London  ( insurance ) and the  Bank of England  are all based in the City. 

Over 500  bank s have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in  Eurobonds ,  foreign exchange market foreign exchange ,  energy   Futures contract futures  and global insurance. The Alternative Investment Market, a market for trades in  Equity investment equities  of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2008, the City of London accounted for 4% of UK  GDP .

London is the world's greatest  foreign exchange market , with much of the trade conducted in the City of London. Of the $3.98 trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2007, trading in London accounted for around $1.36 trillion, or 34.1% of the total. ref name BIS_survey http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf07t.pdf BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey , published in December 2007. ref  The  Pound Sterling , the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held  reserve currency .

Since 1991  Canary Wharf , a few miles east of the City in  Tower Hamlets , has become a second centre for London's financial services industry and houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. This development does not appear to have damaged the City: growth has continued in both locations.

The City has many  church es designed by Sir  Christopher Wren , including  St Paul's Cathedral . The City was the site of the  Great Fire of London  in 1666.
