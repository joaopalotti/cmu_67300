At the end of the twentieth century, Russia experienced many political upheavals. Some people fought to withdraw from the federation. 

Elections are held at all levels. According Steve White, the present government made it clear that they had no plans of establishing a "second edition" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances. ref cite book last1 White first1 Stephen editor1-first Stephen editor1-last White title Developments in Russian Politics 7 year 2010 publisher Palgrave Macmillan location New York isbn 978-0-230-22449-0 chapter Classifying Russia's Politics ref  Richard Sakwa wrote that the Russian government is considered legitimate by the majority of the Russian people.

The United Russia is the ruling party, which supports the government. The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, such as the  People's Freedom Party  and the  Other Russia , have been unable to register due to very strict rules. In the 2000s the government led a war in  Chechnya , and in the process,  civil liberties  and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the  North Caucasus , are frequently violated. In 2008 Putin's government was in a  2008 South Ossetia war war with Georgia  in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.

  History

The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the  Grand Duchy of Moscow . This area served as the main force in later Russian unification and the fight against the  Golden Horde  from Asia. Moscow slowly gained control of the regions around it and took over the cultural and political life of Kievan Rus'.

In the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest,  annexation  and  exploration  to become the  Russian Empire , the third largest empire in history. It stretched from the  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  eastward to the  Pacific Ocean  and  Alaska . The empire was ruled by an  emperor  called the  Tsar .

 Peter the Great  ruled Russia from 1689 until 1725. Peter moved the capital from  Moscow  to a new city named  Saint Petersburg . He made Russian society more modern in many ways. The government began building ships for the Russian navy.

The  Russo-Japanese War  started in 1904 and ended in 1905 with Japan winning the war. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for later  revolution s.

In  October Revolution October 1917 , the  Bolshevik s (later called "Communists"), influenced by the ideas of  Karl Marx  and  Vladimir Lenin , took over the country and murdered the  Tsar  and other people who stood against them. Once they took power, the Bolsheviks, under Vladimir Lenin and  Leon Trotsky , created the first  Marxism Marxist   Communist  State.

From the 1920s to the 1950s,  Josef Stalin  ruled as an absolute dictator of  Soviet Russia , and destroyed anything and anyone that was against his rule, including taking the property of farmers and shopkeepers.  Many millions of people starved and died in the resulting  famine s.  Stalin also removed, or "purged", all military personnel who were not loyal to him, and many were killed or sent to prison camps, or  Gulag gulags , for many years. Even in the gulags, many prisoners died.

Soviet Russia and  Nazi Germany  agreed not to attack each other in 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the agreement and attacked in  Operation Barbarossa . The attack was part of  World War II . The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world  superpower .

From 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the  Soviet Union , or the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  (USSR). People sometimes used the name "Russia" for the whole Soviet Union, or sometimes "Soviet Russia". Russia was only one of 15  Soviet Socialist Republic s. The republic was in fact named the "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic" (RSFSR).

The Soviet Union fell apart in the early 1990s. Russia took over the place of the USSR in the  United Nations  (UN).
