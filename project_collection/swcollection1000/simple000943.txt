 Language families  are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older  language . The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure.

For example,  French language French  and  Spanish language Spanish  both come from  Latin language Latin .  Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way, saying, for example, for good: "bueno" while another group started saying "bon."  Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French, so the two are called different languages.

Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called  Language isolate s .

There also are  Constructed language s, like for example  Esperanto . Constructed languages are made for different reasons: making a 'world language', for fun, for use in fiction, etc.
