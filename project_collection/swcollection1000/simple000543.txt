Year

Unreferenced date December 2011 
One  year  is about 365  day s long (except in a  leap year ). It is the time it takes the  Earth  to go completely around ( orbit ) the  sun  once. A year is actually 3651/4 days long, but a  calendar  has 365 days, except in a leap year.

The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the  Gregorian calendar , but a  fiscal year  or a  school year  can start on a different day of the year.

There are several ways used to measure the length of a year.

  a  solar  year is based on the  season s. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year.  The solar year is 365 days long.
  a  lunar  year is based on the  moon  and is usually 12  lunar month s (29 days, 12  hour s, 44  minute s each) or 354 days long.
  a  tropical  year is the time between two  equinox vernal equinoxes , the first day of spring when the lengths of daylight and night are the same.
  a  sidereal  year measures the time between when a selected  star fixed star  is highest in the  wikt:night night   sky .
  an  anomalistic year  is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun.
  an  eclipse  year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when  solar eclipse s can happen.

Solar and lunar years are used by different  society societies  in daily life. The other measurements are used by  astronomer s.

  there was no year numbered "year zero" in a normal system of counting, because it would mean there is a year earlier than the first year, which was the year  1 AD one  in the  Anno Domini  system, also called 1 CE in the  Common Era , used with our  Gregorian calendar . However, some astronomers call the year 1 BC (or BCE) "year 0" to make it easier for them to count leap years before that year.
