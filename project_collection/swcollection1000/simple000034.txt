The people looked upward with one accord and took it as a favorable omen for their cause. This was the origin of the ''sun of May'' which has appeared in the center of the Argentine flag and on the Argentine coat of arms ever since." 2a1 Kopka 2y 2011 2p 5 2ps : "The sun's features are those of  Inti , the  Inca n sun god.

 Argentina  (officially the  Argentine Republic )  is a country in  South America . Argentina is the second-largest  country  in  South America  and the eighth-largest country in the world.

 Spanish language Spanish  is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. 
There are minorities speaking  Italian language Italian ,  German language German ,  English language English ,  Quechua  and even  Welsh language Welsh  in  Patagonia .

The  capital (city) capital city  of the Argentina is  Buenos Aires , one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest  city cities  in Argentina are  Buenos Aires ,  Cordoba, Argentina Cordoba ,  Rosario ,  Mendoza ,  La Plata ,  Tucuman ,  Mar del Plata ,  Salta ,  Santa Fe, Argentina Santa Fe , and  Bahia Blanca .

Argentina is between the  Andes   mountain range  in the west and the southern  Atlantic Ocean  in the east and south. It is bordered by  Paraguay  and  Bolivia  in the north,  Brazil  and  Uruguay  in the northeast, and  Chile  in the west and south. It also claims the  Falkland Islands  ( Spanish language Spanish :  Islas Malvinas ) and  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands .

  History  
The name  Argentina  comes from the  Latin   argentum  ( silver ) as the  Spain Spanish   conquistador s believed the area had  silver . In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the  Patagonia  (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the  Inca Empire  conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the  Guarani  developed a culture based on  yuca  and  sweet potato  however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in 1818. It grew a lot after immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the "infamous decade" where the country's politics were not stable,  Juan Peron  came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.

In 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was  Jorge Rafael Videla . Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.

One of his successors was another general turned dictator,  Leopoldo Galtieri . By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To try to stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the  Falkland Islands , starting a war. Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again. Galtieri was removed from power and eventually democracy was restored. Galtieri and Videla would be charged with "crimes against humanity" because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president.

Today, Argentina is one of the most important countries in Latin America, though it still has many problems facing it. It has a large economy and is an influential country in the "southern cone" of South America.

  Politics  
Argentina is a  federal republic . The people of Argentina vote for a  President  to rule them and  Senator s and  Deputy Deputies  to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is  Mauricio Macri  since December 2015.

  Administrative divisions
