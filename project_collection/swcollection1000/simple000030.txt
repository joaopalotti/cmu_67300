 Anatomy  is the  research study  of the  body bodies  of living beings. This can be  human people ,  animal s, or  plant s. It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ( organ (anatomy) organs ,  muscle s and  bone s). People who study  anatomy  then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when  Ancient Egypt Egyptians  began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

 Academic  human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.
