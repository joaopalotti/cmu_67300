 Statistics  is the  science  of  Information data . It enables the  data collection collection ,  analysis ,  interpretation understanding , and  presentation  of data. ref Cite book   author   Moses, Lincoln E.   title   Think and Explain with statistics   pages   1 - 3   publisher   Addison-Wesley   year   1986 ref  It helps in the study of many other fields, such as  medicine ,  economics ,  psychology , and  marketing . Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician.

Statistics provides ways to get the data needed for a study without waste, such as  Statistical survey surveys  and controlled  experiment s. Once the data has been collected, there are two basic ways that data can be analysed:

  First, statistics can help  describe  the data. This is known as  descriptive statistics . Descriptive statistics is about finding meaningful ways to  wikt:summary summarize  the data, because it is easier to use the "summary" than having to use the whole set of data all the time. Summarizing the data also allows to find common  pattern s. In statistics, such patterns are called  probability distribution s.  The basic idea is to look at the results of an experiment, and look at how the results are grouped.
  Once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for  prediction . This is called  Inferential statistics Inferential Statistics . As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the  environment , but others are by  Mendelian inheritance inheritance . A  biologist  might therefore make a  Mathematical model model  that says that there's a high  probability , the  offspring  will be small in size if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain  drug  can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a  placebo .

  History  
Statistics have been in use for a long time. The first known statistics are  census  data. The  Babylonia ns did a census around 3500BC, the  Ancient Egypt Egyptians  around 2500 BC, and the Ancient  China Chinese  around 1000 BC.

  Collecting data  
Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect  Information data . The data that we collect in statistics are called  measurement s. After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a  Sample (statistics) sample ) out of the total  population (statistics) population  of viewers. Then we ask each one how often they watch the show, or (better) we measure it by attaching a counter to each of their television sets. For another example, if we want to know whether a certain  drug  can help lower  blood pressure , we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after.

  Methods  
Most often we collect statistical data by doing  survey s or  experiment s. To do a survey, we pick a small number of people and ask them  question s. Then, we use their answers as the data.

The choice of which  individual s to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly  wikt:influences influences  the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away, hard to reach, spot of the lake.

There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples:

  If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real  population . If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called a  chance error  (see  Errors and residuals in statistics ).
  The individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully, usually they will be chosen randomly. If this is not the case, the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called  bias .

  Errors  
We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See also  standard error .

  Descriptive statistics  
  Finding the middle of the data  
The middle of the data is called an  average . The average tells us about a typical individual in the population. There are three kinds of average that are often used: the  mean , the  median  and the  Mode (statistics) mode .

The examples below use this sample data:

  Name | A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J
 ---------------------------------------------
  score| 23  26  49  49  57  64  66  78  82  92

  Mean  
The formula for the  mean  is

 math \bar x = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_N}{N} math 

Where  math x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N math  are the data and  math N math  is the population size. (see  Sigma Notation ).

This means that you add up all the  value s, and then  Division (mathematics) divide  by the number of values.

In our example  math \bar x =  (23+26+49+49+57+64+66+78+82+92)/10 = 58.6 math 

The problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are  wikt:distributed distributed . Values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot. In statistics, these extreme values might be errors of measurement, but sometimes the population really does contain these values. For example, if in a room there are 10 people who make $10/day and 1 who makes $1,000,000/day. The mean of the data is $90,918/day. Even though it is the average amount, the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes, and is probably useless.

  Median  
The  median  is the middle item of the data. To find the median we  sort  the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle. If there is an  even  number of data, there will not be a number right in the middle, so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are "57" and "64", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5.  Another example, like the income example presented for the mean, consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the median is $55 because $55 is the average of the two middle numbers, $50 and $60.  If the extreme value of $1,000,000 is ignored, the mean is $57.  In this case, the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out.  The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of  mean  above.

  Mode  
The  Mode (statistics) mode  is the most frequent item of data. For example the most common letter in English is the letter "e". We would say that "e" is the mode of the distribution of the letters.

For example, if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the mode is $90 because $90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times.

There can be more than one mode.  For example, if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $20, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the modes are $20 and $90.  This is bi-modal, or has two modes.  Bi-modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups.  For instance, the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution.  This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m (5 ft 9 + 1/2 in) for men and 1.622 m (5 ft 4 in) for women.  These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined.

The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order.

  Finding the spread of the data  
Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is. A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the  standard deviation . If the standard deviation of a set of data is small, then most of the data is very close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, though, then a lot of the data is very different from the average.

If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution, then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is  normally distributed ), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation. Not only that, but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation, and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average than three standard deviations.

  Other descriptive statistics  
We also can use statistics to find out that some  percent ,  percentile ,  number , or  Fraction (mathematics) fraction  of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain  category .

For example,  social science social scientists  used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are  males .
