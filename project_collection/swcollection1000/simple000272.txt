 Leather  is the  skin  of an  animal  used as a  material . The skins of  cow s,  pig s, and  goat s are often used to make leather. Skins of  snake s,  alligator s or  crocodile s, and  ostrich es are sometimes used to make fancier leather.  Shoe s,  bag s,  clothes , and  ball s are often made of leather. Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, giraffes, and African elephants, but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but can also be very hard and rare sometimes.
