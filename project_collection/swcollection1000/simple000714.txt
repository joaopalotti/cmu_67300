General semantics

For semantics in general Semantics 
 General semantics  is a  philosophy  that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning. It was created by  Alfred Korzybski  during the  1920s  and early  1930s . 

The goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either  mind mentally  or in  language , that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand  reality  is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed.
