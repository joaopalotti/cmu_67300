Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: "The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitution reduced the powers of the president even further. ref

  History of Finland  
People first came to Finland 10,000 years ago. That was just after an  ice age , after a glacier that covered the ground had receded.

Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language similar to the  Finnish language  that is spoken today. It is known that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the  Iron Age . (The Iron Age in Finland was 2,500-800 years ago).

The first residents in Finland hunted animals, as " hunter-gatherer s".  Some people started to  agriculture farm  crops about 5,200 years ago. Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age.

The ancient Finns were  paganism pagans . The most important god of the Finnish pantheon was  Ukko . He was a god of  sky  and  thunder , much like  Odin , another Scandinavian god-king. These powers were common among the pagan god kings in pantheons ranging from the Finnish Ukko, to the Scandinavian/Germanic/Saxon  Odin , all the way east to  Zeus  of the Greeks and Jupiter of the Romans. 

Around a thousand years ago, when most of Europe was adopting Christianity, Finland also began following Christianity.  During the  Reformation  of Christianity in the 16th century, most Finns became  Protestant s. Some pagan practices still remain amongst the now Christian Finns, such as  bear worship .

From the  Middle Ages  Finland was a part of  Sweden . Then, in the year  1809 ,  Russia  took Finland from Sweden. Finland was a part of Russia, but after a short period of time it became  autonomy autonomous . The Finns essentially controlled Finland, though the Tsar was in control officially. Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency, (called the  markka ''), their own  stamp s and own  custom s. However, Finland did not have its own  army .

On 6 December 1917, Finland became independent, which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia. There was a  October Revolution communist revolution  in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the  Soviet Union . There were  Communism communists  in Finland too, who tried to create a revolution in Finland. This attempt at revolution caused the  Finnish civil war . The communists lost the civil war, and Finland did not change its old capitalist system.

 Stalin , who was the leader of the Soviet Union, did not like having a  Capitalism capitalist  country as its neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to become a  communism communist  state and be a part of the Soviet Union. The leaders of Finland refused: they wanted to stay independent. The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them, which resulted in the  Winter War . There were many battles, that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union.

 Adolf Hitler  was the dictator of Germany, and he wanted to invade the Soviet Union. Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost, so they joined the German invasion, which started in 1941. This part of the  Second World War  is called the  Continuation War  in Finland. However, Finland was not a  fascism fascist  or an  antisemitism antisemitic  country. Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship.

While Germany was losing the war, Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace. Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union, which resulted in peace. Once again Finland had to give up the areas they had conquered. This time, the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought the Germans, and Germans retreated to  Norway , burning down all of Lapland behind them. This is called the  Lapland War .  Finland remained independent.

After the war, many factories were built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories manufactured products like  paper  and  steel . More and more people worked in more advanced jobs, like  high technology . Also, many people went to universities to get a good education. Finland was one of the first countries where most people had  Internet  connections and mobile phones. A well-known company that makes  mobile phone s,  Nokia , is from Finland.

Finland joined the  European Union  in 1995. The Finnish currency was changed to the  euro  in 2002.

  Economy  
Finland has a mixed economy.  Free market  controls most of production and sales of goods, but public sector is involved in services. In 2013, taxes were 44% of gross national product. This is 4th largest in Europe, after Denmark, France and Belgium. ref http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_valtiontalous.html Valtion talous  National Statistics ref  

In 2014 services were 70% of the gross national product. ref http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_kansantalous.html Kansantalous  National Statistics ref  

The largest company in 2014 was oil refinery  Neste Oil . The second largest was  Nokia . Two forest industries  Stora Enso  and  UPM-Kymmene , were numbers three and four. Number five was  Kesko  which sells everyday goods in K-supermarkets. ref name TE500 http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/suuryhtiot-puristivat-vahemmasta-liikevaihdosta-enemman-voittoa-3365520  Talouselama 500, kymmenen suurinta  Talouselama 27.2.2016 ref
