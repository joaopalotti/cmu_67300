 Cuba  is an island country in the  Caribbean Sea . The country is made up of the big  island  of Cuba, the  Isla de la Juventud  island ( Isle of Youth ), and many  archipelagos smaller islands .  Havana  is the capital of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is  Santiago de Cuba . In Spanish, the capital is called "La Habana". Cuba is near the  United States ,  Mexico ,  Haiti ,  Jamaica  and the  Bahamas . People from Cuba are called Cubans. The official language is  Spanish language Spanish . Cuba is warm all year.

In 1492,  Christopher Columbus  landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the  Kingdom of Spain . Cuba became a Spanish colony until the  Spanish-American War  of 1898. After the war, it was part of the  United States . It gained independence in 1902.

In 1959, guerilla fighters led by  Fidel Castro  and  Che Guevara  overthrew Cuba 's dictator  Fulgencio Batista  in what became the 'Cuban Revolution'. Castro began making relations with the  Soviet Union  and tried to close a lot of American businesses in Cuba; the  United States  did not like this. In 1961 Castro officially announced that his government was socialist. The US attempted to  Bay of Pigs Invasion invade Cuba  to regain control of it and overthrow it's communist led government but failed. The  Communist Party of Cuba  was created in 1965 and has ruled the island ever since. Today, Cuba is the only communist state outside of  Asia , in the  Caribbean , and in the  western hemisphere .

  Culture  
Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the  Salsa  and  Mambo (rhythm) Mambo . Because Cubans have ancestors from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.

Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love  music  and  sport s. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms.  Baseball ,  basketball , and  Track and field athletics athletics  events are loved by many Cuban people. The Cuban football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quarter-final and lost against  Sweden  0:8. ref name lifepac 

  History  
  Early history  
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Tainos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Tainos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Tainos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492,  Christopher Columbus  arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them.

The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of  sugar . In the early 1800s, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent  republic  in  1902 . Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the  Platt Amendment . In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba's businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.

  Cuban Revolution  
In 1959,  Fidel Castro  led a revolution against  Fulgencio Batista . Castro took power in Cuba with  Che Guevara  from  Argentina , his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The  Soviet Union  put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the  Cuban Missile Crisis . The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey.

Cuba became a  communist -led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba's sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba's schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in  Africa  to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.

However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power.

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as "The Special Period". Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.

In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though  Fidel Castro  had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2008,  Raul Castro  became the official president of Cuba.

In April 2015, historic talks took place with US  President Obama  and Cuban  Raul Castro General Secretary Raul Castro  in improving relations between the two nations.

The trade embargo issued by  John F Kennedy President Kennedy  in the 1960s has been considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via  Mexico  if they wanted to go to Cuba. Americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke  Cuban cigars . The cigars are smuggled over the US-Canadian border since they are legal in  Canada .

For military service, men from the age of 17 to 28 years old must go into the army for two years. ref Cite web  url    https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html title   CIA - The World Factbook -- Cuba work   cia.gov accessdate   30 January 2016 ref 

  Demographics  
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the  Spain Spanish  settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the  barracoon ) as  New World  slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:

   European people European  Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of  Spain , but the most numerous were the  Canary Islands Canary Islanders ,  Andalusia ns, and Catalans. There was as well some  France French ,  Italy Italian  and  England English  peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like  Havana  and  Pinar de Rio Providence Pinar del Rio . These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.

   Africa ns and  Mulatto  Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of  Africa  but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000  Haiti ans that came to Cuba during the  Haitian Revolution  days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the  Kongo  and  Yoruba  tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others.  Afro-Cuban s range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion ( Santeria ), and customs to the Cuban culture.

   Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean  Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of  Moor  blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like  Guantanamo Bay . They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies.

  Health and education  
Cuba is a  developing country , and is often depicted as a very  Poverty poor  country. In some aspects, however, like  education ,  health care  and  life expectancy  it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America. ref name Harvard http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002  The Cuban Paradox ref  Its  infant death rate  is lower than some developed countries. ref cite web url https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html   title CIA World Factbook  publisher Cia.gov  date   accessdate 2011-09-30 ref  The average life expectancy is 78 years. ref name factbook
