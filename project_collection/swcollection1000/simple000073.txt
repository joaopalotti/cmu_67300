  History  
 Main History of China 

  Ancient (2100 B.C. - 1500 A.D.)  
 Ancient China  was one of the first  civilization s and was active since the  2nd millennium BC  as a  feudalism feudal   society . Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent  writing , ref name Hagg  with the others being  Mesopotamia , the  Indus Valley civilization , the  Maya civilization , the  Minoan civilization  of  ancient Greece , and  Ancient Egypt . ref Gernet, Jacques. [1996] (1996). A history of Chinese civilization Edition 2, illustrated. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-49781-7, 9780521497817. p 40. ref  It reached its golden age during the  Tang Dynasty  (c. A.D. 10th century).  Home of   Confucianism  and  Daoism , it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of  jade , are some classic examples.

Before the  Qin Dynasty  united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the  Warring States Period . Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many great philosophies were born, including  Confucianism  and  Daoism . Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.

Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern  nomadic people  such as the  Turkic peoples  and the  Mongol s led by  Genghis Khan  and  Kublai Khan . During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the  Qing Dynasty Qin ,  Tang Dynasty Tang ,  Yuan Dynasty Yuan  (Mongolian), and  Qing Dynasty Qing . Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.

  A new age  

While China achieved many things in the  First millennium  and early  2nd millennium , it became an  isolationism isolationist  country in the  15th century 15th century C.E.  This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.

By the time of the  Renaissance , European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many  Europe an  countries , such as  Britain  and  France  built  spheres of influence  in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few  centuries , by the  Qing Dynasty , it had fallen behind other countries in  technology , and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the  Opium Wars  to  Britain  in the  19th century .

In 1911, the Republic of China was founded by  Sun Yat-sen , but its government was very weak.  Warlord s controlled many areas.  Chiang Kai-shek  led wars against them, and he became President and dictator.

In 1931, Japan invaded  Manchuria , a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the  Second Sino-Japanese War . The war later became part of  World War II . The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.

However, the  Chinese Civil War  later started between the  Kuomintang  (Nationalists) of the  Republic of China  (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by  Mao Zedong ,  Liu Shaoqi  and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at  industrialization  and collectivization with the  Great Leap Forward  led to the deaths of many people from  famine . The  Cultural Revolution  caused great social upheaval.  After 1976, China underwent  market economy  reforms under  Deng Xiaoping , and experienced rapid economic growth.  China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports.

In recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the  Internet , and  censorship  of news. 1989 was notable for the controversial Tian An Men Massacre.

  Culture  
China is the origin of Eastern  martial art s, called  Kung-fu Kung Fu  or its first name  Wushu . China is also the home of the well-respected  Spa Monastery  and  Wudang Mountains . Martial art started more for the purpose of  survival , defense, and  war fare than  art . Over time some  art form s have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.

China has had renowned  artist s including  Wong Fei Hung  ( Huang Fei Hung  or  Hwang Fei Hung ) and many others.  Art  has also co-existed with a variety of  paint s including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like  Big Mak  are also praised and talked about within the  culture .

China has many traditional  festival s, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is  Chinese New Year . People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

  Festivals  
Spring Festival is the  Chinese New Year .  

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the  Warring States  period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.
