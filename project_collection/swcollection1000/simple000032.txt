The birds are  falcon s,  eagles  and  vulture s. The  Rhesus Macaque  and the red flying  squirrel  are also in Afghanistan.

Many years of  war ,  hunting , and years of no water have killed animals in Afghanistan. There used to be  tigers  in Afghanistan, but now there aren't any. Bears and wolves are almost gone. ref name ngk

Afghanistan is a largely  rural  country, which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced-apart land. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities.  Kabul , the capital, is the largest city. It is along the  Kabul River  south of the  Hindu Kush  range. Other cities in Afghanistan include  Kandahar ,  Herat ,  Mazar-e Sharif , and  Jalalabad . The rural population is made up of  farmer s and  nomad s (people who move or travel from place to place). The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings. Some Afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people escaped from Afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Most of them lived in neighboring  Pakistan  and  Iran .

  History  
Afghanistan is in the  Trail path  of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern  Asia  to  Europe  and the  Middle East . Because of this, many empire builders have decided to rule over the area. Signs that these emperors were near Afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country. ref [Encyclopedia Britannica, Afghanistan History.

They found the skull of a  Neanderthal , or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered  pottery  and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old--evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals. ref name ReferenceA "Afghanistan."

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the  Hindu Kush  as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown rich off the  lapis lazuli  they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the  Iranian plateau  and  Mesopotamia . As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually invented  irrigation  (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This  civilization  (advanced state of organization) is today called BMAC ( Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex ), or the "Oxus civilization". ref Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 58, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7 ref

  Medieval history  

 Arabs  introduced  Islam  in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, many local Islamic dynasties rose to power inside Afghanistan. One of the earliest was the  Tahirids , whose kingdom included  Balkh  and  Herat ; they established independence from the  Abbasids  in 820. The Tahirids were succeeded in about 867 by the  Saffarids  of  Zaranj  in western Afghanistan. Local princes in the north soon became  wikt:feudatory feudatories  of the powerful  Samanids , who ruled from  Bukhara . From 872 to 999, north of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under Samanid rule. ref "Afghanistan." Encyclopaedia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian  literature  arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as  Rudaki  were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover,  Ferdowsi , the author of  Shahnameh , the national  Epic poetry epic  of Iran, and  Rumi , the famous  Sufi  poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as  Avicenna ,  Al-Farabi ,  Al-Biruni ,  Omar Khayyam ,  Al-Khwarizmi , and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as  mathematics ,  astronomy ,  medicine ,  physics ,  geography , and  geology . It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating  Mongol  invasion in the 13th century. ref Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 ISBN 0-8108-2994-0 AFGHANISTAN ref 

 Timur , the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the  Timurids  (1405-1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land "Afghanistan" (meaning "land of the Afghans"). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at  Delhi . From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the  Safavid dynasty Safavids  of  Isfahan  and the  Mughal Empire Mughals  of  Agra  who had replaced the  Lodi dynasty Lodi  and  Sur Empire Suri  Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the  Hotaki dynasty Hotaki  Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar.

In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named  Ahmad Shah Durrani  united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire ( Durrani Empire ). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan ref name ReferenceA  while  Mirwais Hotak  is the grandfather of the nation.

 Recent history 
During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires,  British India  and  Russian Empire Russia . As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, Britain tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under  Amanullah Khan King Amanullah  gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.

The Kingdom of Afghanistan was a  constitutional monarchy  established in 1926. It was the successor state to the  Emirate of Afghanistan . On 27 September 1934, during the reign of Zahir Shah, the Kingdom of Afghanistan joined the  League of Nations .  During  World War II , Afghanistan remained neutral. It pursued a  Diplomacy diplomatic policy  of non-alignment.

The creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a  republic . In 1978, a  Communist  political party supported by the  Soviet Union  seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and  Soviet war in Afghanistan invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 .

Most people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as  Mujahideen  were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The  United States  and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.

After the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative  Islamic  group known as the  Taliban  emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.

The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of  Islamic law . People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only  Pakistan ,  Saudi Arabia  and the  United Arab Emirates  (UAE) accepted them as the official government.

The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected  terrorist s to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were  Osama bin Laden  and members of the  al-Qaeda  terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the  September 11 attacks terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.  The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul, and a new government led by  Hamid Karzai  came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued. The Taliban are coming into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan, Afghans accuse Pakistan's military of being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.

In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first  democracy democratically  elected president of Afghanistan. ref name cia   NATO  began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions. Many schools and colleges were built in the last ten years. Freedom for women has improved. Women can now study, work, drive, and run for office. Many Afghan women work as politicians, some are ministers while at least one is a mayor. Others have opened businesses, or joined the military or police. Afghanistan's economy has also improved dramatically, and NATO agreed in 2012 to help the country for at least another 10 years after 2014. In the meantime, Afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues to establish new ties with other states.
