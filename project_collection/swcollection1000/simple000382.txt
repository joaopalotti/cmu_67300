Page

A  page  can be different things:

  Usually, a  page  is a  Matter physical  sheet of  paper  in a  book ,  magazine ,  newspaper  etc. When a page is not in a book (etc.) it is a  sheet  or  piece  of paper.

  When we talk about computers, a  page  is also a common  abbreviation  in  net jargon  for " webpage ".  Here the page is not paper, it is a piece of information which we can see on a  computer monitor  at one time.  We can  printing print  it to make a real page.  But the information may not fit all on one page, and we can not change it when it is printed - we can change a web page.  So a webpage is not always the same even as a printed copy of that page.  This is a  conceptual metaphor .  It can be confusing.  Someone who uses it is also likely to use other  jargon .

  A  page  is also a boy or a young man who helps carry things and does small jobs for someone. Another word for this is a  pageboy . 

   To page  someone is to contact that person on their  pager : this is a small electronic machine which makes a sound or gives someone a message.
