  History  
The city is named after the river (old  lang-ru grad Moskov , which means "the city next to the Moskva River").  The beginning of the name is not known, but some people have a few ideas. One is that the name might be from a very old  Finnish language Finnic  language, in which it means "dark" and "cloudy". The first Russian reference to Moscow is from 1147 when  Yuri Dolgoruki  called upon the prince of Novgorod-Severski (North  Novgorod ) to "come to me, brother, to Moscow." ref cite web  url http://faculty.oxy.edu/richmond/csp8/history_of_moscow.htm    title The History of Moscow  publisher Occidental College  last Comins-Richmond  first Walter  accessdate 2006-07-03 ref 

Nine years later, in 1156, Prince  Yuri Dolgoruki  ordered the building of a wooden wall, which had to be redone many times, to go around the growing city. ref cite web  url http://russia.nypl.org/events/Kremlin.html   title Russia Engages the World: The Building of the Kremlin, 1156-1516  publisher The New York Public Library  accessdate 2006-07-03 ref  After the attack of 1237-1238, when the  Mongol Empire Mongols  burned the city to the ground and killed its people living there, Moscow grew back and became the capital of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality (an amount of land ruled by a prince) in 1327. ref name golden-ring cite web  url http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf   format PDF title Along the Moscow Golden Ring  publisher Moscow,Russia Tourist Information centre  accessdate 2006-07-05 ref  Its good place on the start of the  Volga River  helped the city to grow slowly bigger and bigger. Moscow turned into a peaceful and rich principality, known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow, for many years and a large number of people from across Russia moved to live there.

Under Ivan I the city replaced  Tver  as a political center of Vladimir-Suzdal and became the only collector of taxes for the Mongol-Tatar rulers. By paying high taxes, Ivan worked out an important deal with the Khan. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed whole to his oldest. However, Moscow did not like the Mongol rule. In 1380, prince  Dmitry Donskoy  of Moscow led a Russian army to an important victory over the  Tatars  in the Battle of Kulikovo. Only two years later Moscow was raided by the Khan Tokhtamysh. In 1480, Ivan III finally broke the Russians free from Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in Russia. ref cite web  url http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html   title The Mongol Connection: Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow  last Vogel  first Michael  publisher Indiana University South Bend  accessdate 2006-07-03 ref  Under Ivan III the city became the capital of an empire that would eventually include all of  Russia and other countries.

In 1609 the  Sweden Swedish  army, led by Count Jacob De la Gardie and Evert Horn, marched from Veliky Novgorod toward Moscow to help  Tsar  Vasili Shuiski. They entered Moscow in 1610 and stopped the revolution against the Tsar, but left early in 1611. After that the Polish invaded. During the Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) hetman (army commander) Stanislaw Zolkiewski entered Moscow after he defeated the Russians in the Battle of Klushino. The 17th century had lots of revolutions, such as the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.

The  Black Death plague  of 1654-1656 killed half the population of Moscow. ref http://cns.miis.edu/research/antiplague/pdfs/melikishvili.pdf Genesis of the Anti-Plague System: The Tsarist Period ref  The city stopped being Russia's capital in 1712, after the building of  Saint Petersburg  by  Peter I of Russia Peter the Great  near the  Baltic Sea Baltic coast  in 1703. The Plague of 1771 was the last big plague in central Russia, killing 100,000 people in Moscow alone. During the  French invasion of Russia  in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and ran away, as  Napoleon I of France Napoleon 's army was coming near to the city on 14 September. Napoleon's army, which was very  Hunger hungry  and cold had to leave and was nearly destroyed by the freezing Russian winter and some attacks by the army.

Many factories were moved away, and much of the government was too, and from 20 October the city was declared to be under  siege . Its people who stayed built and used antitank defences, while the city was bombed from the air.  Joseph Stalin  (the leader of Russia) did not leave the city, so the general staff remained in the city as well. Even with a siege going on, the building of the  Moscow Metro  system continued through the war, and by the end of the war a few new metro lines were opened.
