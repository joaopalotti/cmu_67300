 Andouille  is a type of  pork   sausage . It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork  meat ,  fat ,  intestines  (tubes going to the  stomach ), and  tripe  (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from  France  or  Germany  (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the  United States USA  is the "Cajun" style. 

Other sorts are "French andouille" and "German andouille"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra  sodium chloride salt ,  black pepper , and  garlic . Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).
