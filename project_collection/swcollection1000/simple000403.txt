In English, proper nouns are not normally preceded by an  Article (grammar) article  or other limiting  modifier  (such as  any  or  some ), and are used to denote a particular person, place, or object without regard to any descriptive meaning the word or phrase may have (for example, a town called "Newtown" may be, but does not necessarily have to be, a new [recently built] town). ref cite web  title  What is a proper noun?   url   http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAProperNoun.htm   date  5 January 2004   work  LinguaLinks Library, Version 5.0  publisher  SIL International   accessdate 2010-09-07 ref 

Which nouns are considered proper names depends on language. For example, names of days and months are considered proper names in English, but not in Spanish, French, Swedish, Slovenian or  Finnish language Finnish , where they are not capitalized.
