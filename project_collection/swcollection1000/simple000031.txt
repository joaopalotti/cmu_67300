An  asteroid  is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the  Sun . It is like a  planet  but smaller. They range from less than 1 km (over 1000 feet) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have  asteroid moon s.

The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient  Greek language . Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the  Sun , while stars only seem to move because the  Earth  spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own  light . Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named  1 Ceres , and is the biggest object in the  asteroid belt . Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like  3 Juno Juno ,  2 Pallas , and  4 Vesta  were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized  telescope s find thousands of asteroids every month.  

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the  Solar System . These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide but  some are made of  carbon  or  metal . Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our  Solar System  are in the  asteroid belt  between  Mars (planet) Mars  and  Jupiter (planet) Jupiter . Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called  Near-Earth asteroid s. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off  K/T extinction event all the dinosaurs  and caused some of the other  extinction event s.
