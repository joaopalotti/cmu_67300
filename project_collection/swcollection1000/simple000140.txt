Experiment

An  experiment  is a test of an  idea  or a  wiktionary:method method . It is often used by  scientist s and  engineer s.  An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world.  Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of  scientific method .

Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When  Einstein  said that  gravity  could affect  light , it took a few years before  astronomers  could test it.  General relativity  predicts that the path of light is bent in a  gravitational field ; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant  quasar s being deflected as it passes the  Sun . ref Kennefick, Daniel 2005.

Now, a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas, there have been many tests, all of which have been consistent with Einstein's predictions. But, one day, we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work. What we test are  Implication (grammar) implication s of the theory, because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once.

  Famous experiments  
   Galileo Galilei  did some experiments about  free fall  (1623)
   Benjamin Franklin  showed that  lightning  is a form of  electricity  (1752)
  The  Michelson-Morley experiment  proved a flaw in old  physics , and prompted  Einstein 's work (1887)
   Ivan Pavlov  did some experiments about the  classical conditioning  of  dog s (1927)
  The  Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment  proved DNA was the  molecule  which caused  heredity  (1944)
   Stanley Milgram  showed that people follow orders; this became known as the  Milgram experiment  (1961)
