The  Pacific Ocean  is the body of  water  between  Asia  and  Australia  in the west,  the Americas  in the east, the  Southern Ocean  to the south, and the  Arctic Ocean  to the north. It is the largest named  ocean  and it covers one-third of the surface of the entire world. It joins the  Atlantic Ocean  at a line drawn   south  from Cape Horn,  Chile / Argentina  to  Antarctica , and joins the  Indian Ocean  at a line drawn  south from  Tasmania ,  Australia  to Antarctica.

As the Atlantic slowly gets wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking. It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the center of the  Earth  - this is called  subduction .  This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many  earthquake s and  volcano es when the  wikt:pressure pressure  builds up and is quickly released as large  explosion explosions  of hot  Rock (geology) rocks  and  dust .  When an earthquake happens under the sea, the quick jerk causes a  tsunami .  This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else.  Many of the Earth's volcanoes are either  island s in the Pacific, or are on  continent s within a few hundred  kilometer s of the ocean's edge.  Plate tectonics  are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller.
