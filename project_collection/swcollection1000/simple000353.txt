Now

Now  is the  time span  between the  past  and the  future . It can be long (like an  eon  in  geologic time ) or short (like a  picosecond ) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some  time horizon  when a  choice decision  must be made. It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay.

"I want to know what you think, now."

"What do you think now?"

"Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country."

 Mathematics  and  measurement  assume that everything used in one  equation   equals  the same quantities at the beginning of  calculation  or  axiomatization  as at the end. That means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of " equal " means "equal from the time the  wikt:process process  starts to the time it ends." In  General Semantics  and  E Prime  the words  equal ,  remain  (for the past until  now ) and  become  (for  now  into the future) replace the  verb  " to be " for this reason.

 Algebra  is now often called  snapshot algebra  or  algebra of seeing  because of this dependence on time. If any  action  or  event  were possible between steps in algebraic analysis, then, in theory, one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all. For these reasons the idea of  statistics  and also  knowledge  and  knowledge management  are sometimes questioned, for instance, in the book  Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics . A major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past, and  now , after some key conditions change.
