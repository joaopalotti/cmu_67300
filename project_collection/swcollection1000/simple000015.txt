 Australia , officially called the  Commonwealth of Australia , is a  country  and  sovereign state  in the  southern hemisphere , located on its own  continent  between the  Pacific Ocean  and the  Indian Ocean . Its  capital city  is  Canberra .

Australia is the  List of countries by area sixth biggest country in the world  by land area, and is part of the  Oceania Oceanic  and  Australasia n regions. Australia,  New Zealand ,  New Guinea  and other islands on the Australian  tectonic plate  are together called  Australasia , which is one of the world's great  ecozone s. When other Pacific islands are included with Australasia, it is called  Oceania .

23 ndash 24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. The country is divided up into six  States of Australia states , and more than half of Australia's  population  lives in and around the cities of  Sydney ,  Melbourne ,  Brisbane ,  Perth, Western Australia Perth  and  Adelaide .

Australia is known for its  mining , its production of  wool , and as the world's largest producer of  bauxite . ref cite web url http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF title Alcola World Alumina Australia publisher MAMS.RMIT.edu.au accessdate December 11, 2014 ref  Its  emblem  is a flower called the Golden Wattle.

The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many  animals  and  plants  live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the  kangaroo , the  koala , the  emu , the  kookaburra , and the  platypus .

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the  Australian Aborigine s. For the history of Australia, see  History of Australia .

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from  Britain , became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first  Prime Minister of Australia  was  Edmund Barton  in 1901. Australia is a member of the  United Nations  and the  Commonwealth of Nations . It is a  Parliamentary system parliamentary democracy  and a  constitutional monarchy  with  Queen Elizabeth II Elizabeth II  as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a  Governor-General of Australia Governor-General  who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

  History  
  Aboriginal people

The  Australian Aborigine Australian Aboriginal  people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier. ref Hesp, Patrick A.  et al  1999.

They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the  Cumberland Plain  where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. Citation  This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in  Victoria, Australia Victoria  and  Tasmania . Citation  The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The  boomerang  was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

  Terra Australis  
In the 1600s,  Dutch people Dutch  merchants traded with the islands of  Batavia  (now  Indonesia ), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent  Abel Tasman  on a voyage of discovery and he found  Tasmania , which he named  Van Diemen's Land . Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The  British Government  was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain  James Cook  to the  Pacific Ocean . His ship,  HMS Endeavour , carried the famous scientists, Sir  Joseph Banks  and Dr Solander who were going to  Tahiti  where they would watch the planet  Venus (planet) Venus  pass in front of the  Sun . Captain Cook's secret mission was to find " Terra Australis " (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found  New Zealand  and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the  horizon . Captain Cook named that bit of land  Point Hicks . They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw "New South Wales". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

  Settlement  
 File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg thumb|Captain  Arthur Phillip  raises the British flag at  Sydney  in 1788. 

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and  gaol s ( jail s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the  First Fleet  of eleven ships set sail from  Portsmouth  carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain  Arthur Phillip . They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that  Botany Bay  was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was "the finest harbor in the world!" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of  George III of the United Kingdom King George III  of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to  Norfolk Island  and to  Van Diemen's Land  (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

  Exploration  
 File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg thumb|Governor  Lachlan Macquarie  was the 5th  governor of New South Wales  and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place. 

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the  Blue Mountains (New South Wales) Blue Mountains . They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813  Gregory Blaxland ,  William Lawson (explorer) William Lawson  and a 17-year-old called  William Charles Wentworth  crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor,  Lachlan Macquarie  founded the town of  Bathurst, New South Wales Bathurst  on the other side, 100 miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain  Charles Sturt  were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills.  Ludwig Leichhardt  got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major  Thomas Mitchell  was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The  Henty Brothers Henty brothers  had come from  Tasmania , had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

 Self government 

The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy.  William Wentworth  started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand  Parliamentary democracy democratic government . In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote.  New South Wales Legislative Council  had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the  right to vote  was given to all men over 21 in  South Australia . The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the  Parliament of South Australia  in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections. ref name aec.gov.au cite web url http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm   title AEC.gov.au  publisher AEC.gov.au  date 25 Oct. 2007  accessdate 27 Jun. 2010 ref ref http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy   WebCite url http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7 date  2011-08-14 ref 

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

Until 1901, Australia was not a  nation , it was six separate  colony colonies  governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the  British Empire , and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the  trade union s were very strong, and they started a political party, the  Australian Labor Party . Australia passed many laws to help the  worker s. ref http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission ref 

In 1914, the  World War I First World War  started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against  Germany ,  Austria-Hungary  and the  Ottoman Empire . Australian soldiers were sent to  Gallipoli Campaign Gallipoli , in the  Ottoman Empire . They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on  ANZAC Day . They also fought on the  Western Front . More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the  Great Depression  of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against  Nazi Germany  when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the  Japanese Occupation of Singapore Fall of Singapore  by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the  United States Navy , the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the  Snowy Mountains Scheme . Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from  Italy  and  Greece , other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like  Turkey  and  Lebanon . An important new party, the  Liberal Party (Australia) Liberal Party of Australia  was made by  Robert Menzies  in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then  Gough Whitlam  won for the  Australian Labor Party Labor Party . Whitlam made changes, but he made the  Australian Senate Senate  unhappy and the  Governor-General of Australia Governor-General  sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then  Malcolm Fraser  won a few elections for the  Liberal Party of Australia Liberal Party .

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from  China ,  Vietnam ,  Malaysia  and other countries in  Asia . Australia became more  multicultural . In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against  dictatorship s in  Korea  and  Vietnam  and later  Iraq . Australian soldiers also helped the  United Nations  in countries like  East Timor  in 1999.

In 1973, the famous  Sydney Opera House  opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of  Australian cinema Australian movies , actors and  Australian music singers  became famous around the world. In the year 2000,  2000 Summer Olympics Sydney had the Summer Olympics .

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under  Bob Hawke  and  Paul Keating , then the Liberal Party under  John Howard  made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad  recession  in 1991, but when other Western countries  Global financial crisis of September-October 2008 had trouble with their economies in 2008 , Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like  Uluru ) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as  immigrant s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are  refugee s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after  World War Two , including around 660,000 refugees. ref http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ref
