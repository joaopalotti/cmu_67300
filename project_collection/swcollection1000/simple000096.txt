A  coin  is normally a  round  piece of  metal  that is used as  currency , or money. Coins have been made for about 2600 years; the first place to make coins was Lydia (modern  Turkey ). ref cite web url http://encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com/pages/13993/Lydia.html title Lydia accessdate 2009-12-12 ref 

Most people use coins as  currency . They usually have lower value than  banknotes . 

  Appearance  
Many coins have unique or complicated  decorations ; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person's  head  on it. 

The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things  random ly. This is called "tossing a coin".  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called "heads", if the other side is facing up it is called "tails". Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. Tossing a coin can be a type of  gambling , which is  illegal  (against the law) in some  country countries .

  Other views  
Some people see coins as a sign of greed, such as some  Communist s and  Puritan s, who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins, and  ascetic s, who often keep little in the ways of  money  (coins), leading a "poor"-lifestyle.

  Collecting  
 main Coin collecting 
Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like  copper . Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.
