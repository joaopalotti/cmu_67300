 Toronto  is the  capital city  of the  Provinces and territories of Canada province  of  Ontario  in  Canada . It is also the largest  city  in both Ontario and Canada. Found on the north-west side of  Lake Ontario , the City of Toronto has a  population  of over 3 million people and even more people live in the  region s around it. All together, the  Greater Toronto Area  is home to over 6 million people making it the biggest  metropolitan area  in Canada.

 History 
Toronto was created in 1793 by  John Graves Simcoe  as the capital of what was then called  Upper Canada . At the time it was called the "Town of  York " after the  Duke of York , but was given its current name in 1834. With the Canadian  Confederation  in 1867 it became the capital of the newly-created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with  Montreal  in  Quebec ) that wanted to be the capital of Canada, but  Queen Victoria  decided that  Ottawa  should be the national capital as it was located between the two.

As the 19th century moved on the city began to grow. This was many because of  immigration , where people from all over the world left their home and  Immigration to Canada moved to Canada . Many of the immigrants were  Irish people Irish  and they brought their  Catholicism Catholic faith  with them when they left  Ireland  because of the  Irish Potato Famine .

During  World War I  and  World War II , Toronto had an important part in  military , being used to train members of the  Canadian Army . After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the  Government of Ontario  decided to create  Metropolitan Toronto  in 1954, joining together a number of local  Municipality municipalities . These were  Old Toronto ,  York, Ontario York ,  East York, Ontario East York ,  North York, Ontario North York ,  Etobicoke , and  Scarborough, Ontario Scarborough .

By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. So the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a " megacity " in 1998, and the first  mayor  of Toronto was  Mel Lastman . As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events, such as  World Youth Day  in 2002,  WorldPride  in 2014, and the  2015 Pan American Games .

 Things to see and do 
Toronto has a  humid continental climate  ( Dfa  in the  Koppen climate classification ). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the  lake  is not big enough to keep its  temperature  mild. clarify 

As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of  North America , Toronto is a popular destination for  tourist s. It is where you can find the  CN Tower , the tallest free-standing (not supported)  structure  in the  Americas  and one of the  Seven Wonders of the Modern World . There are some other buildings, such as  Toronto City Hall City Hall  and the  Rogers Centre , that are well-known for their design style. There are also many  skyscraper s, because many large  bank s of Canada and other  company companies  have their main offices in Toronto, and the  Toronto Stock Exchange  which is the biggest  stock market  in Canada.

Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where  Government of Ontario the provincial government  meets, and visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the  legislature  in Queen's Park. There are also a number of museums, including the  Royal Ontario Museum , the  Art Gallery of Ontario , the  Ontario Science Centre , the  Hockey Hall of Fame , and the headquarters of the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . In the suburbs of the city is the  Toronto Zoo  and  Canada's Wonderland , and many visitors also like to go to  Niagara Falls , just an hour's drive away from Toronto.

Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the  downtown  area are a number of  shopping centre s, including the  Eaton Centre ,  St. Lawrence Market , and the  Distillery District . There are also several  theatre s, many which are run by the  Mirvish  family. The  Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts , opened in June 2006, is home to the  Canadian Opera Company  and the  National Ballet of Canada . Across the  harbor  are the  Toronto Islands , the best-known of which is  Centre Island .

Toronto has many  sports  teams, some of which belong to  Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada the most commonly-followed leagues  in North America. They include the  Toronto Maple Leafs  in  ice hockey  and the  Toronto Raptors  in  basketball , both of which play in the  Air Canada Centre . The nearby Rogers Centre is where the  Toronto Blue Jays   baseball  team plays, and meanwhile,  BMO Field  in  Exhibition Place  is home to the  Toronto Argonauts  in  Canadian football  and  Toronto F.C. , a  soccer  club.

Toronto is a very  multicultural  city, because different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Greektown, Little Portugal, and many more places where different  culture s are kept alive. These people hold  festival s where they share their culture to others, and among the most popular is the  Canadian National Exhibition  (CNE), which happens every year in August.
