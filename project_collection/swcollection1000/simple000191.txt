God's eye view

God's eye view  is a name for a  point of view  where the speaker or writer assumes they have  knowledge  only  God  would have.  It appears several ways:

 In  religion , when an  institution  claims to speak for a  divine being .

 In  writing , when an  author  leaves the  point of view  of the  main actor  to start writing about things they could not know if the story were in real life.

 In  science , when a  scientist  ignores the way a  subject-object problem  affects  statistics  or an  observer effect  affects  experiment .

 In  medicine  when the  Medical doctor doctor  makes a claim that  The Gaze  he uses on a patient, actually sees the problem, rather than making a guess at a problem.

 In  ethics  when a statement is made about who or what is right, without an honest attempt to make the  wikt:process process  of deciding this consider all points of view.

A special case of the last is in a  wiki  with a  GodKing .  Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right, without making any special effort to be fair to other views.

Many people think  Rene Descartes  took a God's eye view when he said  cogito ergo sum .   George Berkeley  argued that  optics  from  Isaac Newton  and  Johannes Kepler  also had this problem.
