 Air  is the  Earth 's  atmosphere . Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear  gas  in which living things live and  breathe . It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no  color  or  odor smell . It has  mass  and  weight . It is a  matter  as it has mass and weight. Air creates  atmosphere pressure atmospheric  pressure . There is no air in the  vacuum  of the  cosmos . 

Air is a  mixture  of about 78%  nitrogen , 21%  oxygen , 0.9%  argon , 0.04%  carbon dioxide , and very small amounts of other gases. ref citeweb url http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm title composition of air ref ref Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013).

New York Times.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0 ref   There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals need the  oxygen  in the air to live. In the  human body , the  lung s give oxygen to the  blood , and give back  carbon dioxide  to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

 Wind  is moving air.  Air  air pollution can be polluted  by some gases (such as    carbon monoxide ),  smoke , and  wikt:ash ash . This  pollution  is one of the reasons for  global warming , by causing the " greenhouse effect ".

Aircraft use  propeller s to move air over a  wing , which allows them to  flight fly .  Pneumatics  use  air pressure  to move things.
