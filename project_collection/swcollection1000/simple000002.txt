  The Month  
 File:Hw-augustus.jpg thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor  Augustus Caesar , after whom August is named 
This month was first called  Sextilis  in  Latin , because it was the sixth month in the old  Roman calendar . The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with  Romulus and Remus Romulus .  October  was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King  Numa Pompilius  about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the  decemvirs  about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In  153 BC   January 1  was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for  Augustus Caesar  who became  Roman consul  in this month. ref name infoplease Citation  title History of August  url http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html   ref   The month has 31 days because  Julius Caesar  added two days when he created the  Julian calendar  in  45 BC . August is after July and before September.

August, in either  hemisphere , is the seasonal equivalent of  February  in the other. In the  Northern hemisphere  it is a  summer  month and it is a  winter  month in the  Southern hemisphere .

No other month in a  common year  starts on the same day of the week as August, but August starts on the same day of the week as  February  in  leap year s. August ends on the same day of the week as  November  every year.

During common years, August starts on the same day of the week as  March  and  November  of the preceding year (Additionally, August of a common year that follows another common year starts on the same day of the week as  February  of the preceding year) and ends on the same day of the week and  March  and  June  of the preceding year; during leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as  June  and ends on the same day of the week as  September , both of the preceding year.

In years that precede common years, August starts and ends on the same day of the week as  May  of the following year; in years that precede leap years, August starts on the same day of the week as  October , and ends on the same day of the week as  February  and  October , both of the following year.
