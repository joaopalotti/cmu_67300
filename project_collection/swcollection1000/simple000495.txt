 History 
 see also History of the United Kingdom 
History begins when there is a written record. Writing was brought to Britain by the  Roman Empire Romans . Rome ruled in Britain from 44AD to 410AD, but they only ruled England and Wales. The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth valley, or Ireland; their northern boundary varied from time to time, and was marked for a while at  Hadrian's Wall .

After the Romans, two waves of  immigration immigrants  came to Britain. The first were  Germanic peoples German  tribes: the  Angles ,  Saxons  and  Jutes .  English language English , the language, is a development from  Anglo-Saxon   Old English , and is a Germanic language.  The second were the  Viking s.

 Britain unified 
After a long period when  England  was split into various kingdoms, it was made into one country by AEthelstan ( Athelstan ) in 945 small AD small . England and Wales were unified by  Edward I of England Edward I  (Longshanks) by force in the 13th century.

Union with Scotland took much longer; there were hundreds of years of conflicts between both parts of Britain. This union between England and Scotland in 1707 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged Scotland and England into one country.

In 1603, when  Queen   Elizabeth I of England  died, her closest relative was  King   James I of England James VI of Scotland . He became king of England as well as king of Scotland. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union, which joined the two countries into one country called  The Kingdom of Great Britain  under Queen  Anne of Great Britain Anne .

By 1800, both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over  Ireland  since 1200. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. The new country was called the  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the  Irish Free State  (now called  Republic of Ireland Ireland ) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties (called  Northern Ireland ) continue to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland .

 Parliament 
The British people are ruled by  Parliament , not by monarchs. Parliament started in 1215 as an advisory body for the monarch, but by the 17th century it had gained enough power to successfully defeat  Charles I of England Charles I , in the  English Civil War .  Oliver Cromwell  became Lord Protector. Though the monarchy was restored after his death, the Crown slowly became the secondary power, and Parliament the first. Members of Parliament (called MPs) were elected, but until the early twentieth century, only men who owned property could vote. In the nineteenth century, more people were given  suffrage  (the right to vote), but even so, by 1900, women could not vote, and only 40% of men were rich enough to vote. But in 1928, all adults, male and female, got the vote: this is called universal suffrage.

Parliament is in London, but it has power over the whole of the UK. Today, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own parliaments as well, but they have more limited powers. There are also parliaments in the  Isle of Man  and the  Channel Islands , which are islands that are partly controlled by the UK, and partly independent.

The members of Parliament belong to  political party political parties : the biggest parties are the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together. A party with more than half the seats (a majority) forms the government; the leader of the party becomes the  Prime Minister , who then appoints other ministers. Because the government has a majority in Parliament, it can normally control what laws are passed.

 Geography 
 File:United Kingdom labelled map7 vector.svg thumb|175px|The  countries of the United Kingdom 
 File:uk topo en.jpg thumb|175px|left|The topography of the UK 
The UK is made up of four different countries:  Wales ,  England  and  Scotland  and  Northern Ireland . The capital city of Wales is  Cardiff . The capital city of England is  London . The capital city of Scotland is  Edinburgh  and the capital city of Northern Ireland is  Belfast . Other large cities in the UK are  Birmingham ,  Bristol ,  Manchester ,  Liverpool, Mersyside Liverpool ,  Newcastle upon Tyne ,  Leeds ,  Sheffield ,  Glasgow ,  Southampton ,  Leicester ,  Coventry ,  City of Bradford Bradford  and  Nottingham .

The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland  Europe . Around the UK are the  North Sea , the  English Channel  and the  Atlantic Ocean . The UK also rules, usually indirectly, a number of smaller places (mostly islands) round the world, which are known as  overseas territories . They are remnants of the   British Empire .

The  weather  of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable. Summers are moderately warm, winters are cool to cold. Rain falls throughout the year, and more on the west than the east because of its northerly latitude and the warm water from the  Atlantic Ocean 's  Gulf Stream . The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by  Arctic  air from the north-east or hot air from the  Sahara .

 Politics 
 File:Westminster palace.jpg left|thumb| Westminster ,  London  has the clock tower, which holds the bell  Big Ben 

The UK is a  parliament ary  democracy  based on a  constitutional monarchy constitutional  and  hereditary monarchy . The people of the United Kingdom vote for a  Member of Parliament members of Parliament  to speak for them and to make laws for them. Queen  Elizabeth II  is the  monarch queen  of the UK and is the  head of state . Even though she is the head of state, she does not actually govern the country. The  government , led by the  Prime Minister , governs the country and decides  policy . Today, the Prime Minister is  Theresa May , who is the leader of the Conservative  political party party  and was not directly elected by the people of the country.

 Parliament  is where laws are made. It has three parts: the  House of Commons of the United Kingdom House of Commons , the  House of Lords , and the Queen. The House of Commons is the most powerful part. It is where Members of Parliament sit. The Prime Minister sits here as well, because they are a Member of Parliament. The people who sit in the House of Lords are called peers: they are not chosen by the people. Most peers are now appointed by the government. There are some who are hereditary  Peerage peers  (their fathers were peers); and a few others, such as certain  bishop s in the established  Church of England , and the  Judiciary  (Law Lords).

Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education, health and Scottish law. Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time.

 Military 
The UK has a military of around 223,000 people, not including reserve forces. The UK has one of the most advanced military in the world, alongside such countries such as the  USA  and  France , and operates a large army ( British Army ), a sizable navy ( Royal Navy ) and air force ( Royal Air Force ). From the 18th century to the early 20th century, the UK was one of the most powerful nations in the world, with a huge navy (due to the fact it was surrounded by sea, so a large navy was the most practical option). This status has faded in recent times, but the UK remains a member of various military groups such as the  United Nations Security Council UN Security Council  and  NATO . It is also still seen as a great military power.

 Economy 
The UK is a  Development developed  country with the sixth largest  economy  in the world. It was a  superpower  during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world, in politics, economics (For it was the wealthiest country at the time.) and in military strength. Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s. The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the  British Empire  in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its leading role in global affairs. The UK has strong economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a  nuclear power . It is a member state of the  European Union  at the moment, but is planning on leaving after brexit was voted for. The UK holds a permanent seat on the  United Nations Security Council , and is a member of the  G8 ,  NATO ,  World Trade Organization  and the  Commonwealth of Nations .

 London , the capital, is famous as being the largest centre of  finance  in the world, along with  New York City  in the  United States .

 Literature

 File:Paget holmes.png thumb| Sherlock Holmes  and Dr. Watson 
 William Shakespeare  was an  English people English   playwright . He wrote plays in the late 16th century. Some of his plays were  Romeo and Juliet  and  Macbeth . In the 19th century,  Jane Austen  and  Charles Dickens  were novelists. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist  H.G. Wells  and  J.R.R. Tolkien . The children's fantasy  Harry Potter  series was written by  J.K. Rowling .  Aldous Huxley  was also from the United Kingdom.

English language literature is written by authors from many countries. Eight people from the United Kingdom have won the  Nobel Prize in Literature .  Seamus Heaney  is a writer who was born in  Northern Ireland .

 Arthur Conan Doyle  from  Scotland  wrote the  Sherlock Holmes  detective novels. He was from  Edinburgh . The poet  Dylan Thomas  brought Welsh culture to international attention.

 Education 
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have separate, but similar, systems of education. They all have rules that education is required from ages five to eighteen, except for in Scotland where school departure is allowed from the age of sixteen. Many children attend state schools and other children attend private schools.

Britain's universities are the  University of Cambridge  and  University of Oxford , and London universities ( University College London , the  London School of Economics and Political Science London School of Economics ,  King's College London  and  Imperial College London ) which collectively form the 'Golden Triangle' of UK universities.

A broader group of twenty universities form the  Russell Group , which account for two thirds of research grants and contract funding out of the total of 100 universities.

 Transport 
Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road (unlike the Americas and some of the rest of Europe), and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle. The road network on the island of  Great Britain  is extensive, with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times. Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were made to the needs of the motor car. The high speed  motorway  (freeway) network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities.

The system of  rail transport  was invented in England and Wales, so the United Kingdom has the oldest  railway  network in the world. It was built mostly during the Victorian era. At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from  London  to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions. The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station and is built to the same standard as the French TGV system. The  British Rail  network is part privatised, with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions, whilst the tracks, signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail. The system of underground railways in London, known as the  London Underground Tube , has been copied by many other cities.

Most domestic  air travel  in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England.  London Heathrow Airport London-Heathrow  is the nation's largest airport and is one of the most important international  Airline hub hub s in the world. Other major airports with principal international service include London-Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow.

An extensive system of  ferry  networks operate between the Scottish islands, and major ferry routes operate between England and France (via the English Channel), Scotland-Northern Ireland (via the Irish Sea) and England/Wales-Republic of Ireland (from Liverpool/Holyhead).
