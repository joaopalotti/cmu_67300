 Zinc , sometimes called  spelter , ref Citation url http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/spelter title Spelter publisher Encyclo accessdate 2009-08-01 isbn 0665822448 ref  is a  chemical element . It is a  transition metal , a group of  metal s. It is sometimes considered a  post-transition metal . Its symbol on the  periodic table  is " Zn ". Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an  atomic number  of 30. Zinc has a  mass number  of 65.38. It contains 30  proton s and 30  electron s. In total, 29  isotope s of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are  radioactive decay radioactive . Their  half-life (element) half-lives  are between 40  millisecond s for  sup 57 sup Zn and 5x10 sup 18 sup  years for  sup 70 sup Zn.

Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for  galvanizing  and  battery batteries . It is the fourth most common metal.

 Properties 
 Physical properties 
Zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal. When it has just been cut, zinc has a whitish-grey color. If it is exposed to  air , it will not stay shiny for long. Its melting point is at ( convert 419.58 C F ) and boiling point is ( convert 907.0 C F ). This temperature is lower than most  transition metal s but higher than  tin  or  lead . It can be melted on a cooking stove. It boils at a low temperature for a metal. ref name ZincMetalProps Citation  url http://www.galvanizeit.org/aga/designing-fabricating/design-considerations/zinc-metal-properties title Zinc Metal Properties publisher American Galvanizers Association year 2008 accessdate 2009-02-15 ref  It is not magnetic.

 Chemical properties 
Zinc is a  reactive  metal. It is about as reactive as  aluminium  and more reactive than most of the more common metals, such as  iron ,  copper ,  nickel , and  chromium chrome . It is less reactive than  magnesium .

Zinc is a  chalcophile . This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen. That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore, not zinc oxide.

 Chemical compounds

Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements. These chemical compounds are only in one  oxidation state : +2. A +1 compound has been found but it is hard to make. There are no other oxidation states other than +1 or +2. ref Citation last Brady first James E. coauthors Humiston, Gerard E.; Heikkinen, Henry title General Chemistry: Principles and Structure publisher John Wiley & Sons year 1983 edition 3rd page 671 isbn 047186739X ref  Most of these compounds have no color.

 File:Sphalerite.jpg thumb|Sphalerite, a common zinc ore 
Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's  crust (geology) crust . Zinc is only found as zinc compounds.  Sphalerite , a  mineral  that is made of  zinc sulfide , is a main  ore  of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores.

There are some other zinc ores, such as  smithsonite  (zinc carbonate) and a zinc  silicate  mineral. They are less common.

 Preparation 
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by  flotation . There is a  detergent  that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and  sulfur dioxide . ref name Zinchand Citation url http://books.google.com/?id=laACw9i0D_wC title Zinc Handbook first Frank C. last Porter publisher CRC Press year 1991 isbn 9780824783402 ref
