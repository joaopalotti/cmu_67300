 Antarctica  is the  Earth 's  wikt:southern southernmost   continent . It is on the  South Pole . It's almost entirely south of the  Antarctic Circle . Around Antarctica is the  Southern Ocean . At 14.0 million km sup 2 sup  (5.4 million sq mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after  Asia ,  Africa ,  North America , and  South America . About 98% of Antarctica is covered by  ice . This ice averages at least 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mi) in thickness. 

Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest and  wind iest continent. It is also the highest of all the continents. ref cite web   title National Geophysical Data Center   publisher National Satellite, Data, and Information Service  url http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/relief_slides2.html   accessdate 9 June 2006  Choose the South Pole view. ref  Antarctica is considered a  desert . ref name Campbell Campbell I.B. and Claridge G.G.C. 1987.  http://books.google.com/books?id=WfhG-Qxz8psC&pg=PA4&dq=is+Antarctica+a+desert&hl=en&ei=ig6-S5nXL8H88AbA_JyBCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=is%20Antarctica%20a%20desert&f=false Antarctia:soils, weathering, processes and environment  p4 Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

However, about 1,000 to 5,000 people live through the year at the  science  stations in Antarctica. Only plants and animals that can live in cold live there. The animals include  penguin s,  Pinniped seals ,  nematode s,  tardigrade s and  mite s. Plant life includes some  grass  and  shrub s,  algae ,  lichen ,  fungi , and  bacteria .

The first known sighting of the continent was in 1820. Antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the 19th century. This was because of its  wikt:hostile hostile  environment, few  wikt:resource resources , and  wikt:isolation isolation . The first official use of the name  Antarctica  as a continental name in the 1890s is said to have been used by Scottish  Cartography cartographer   John George Bartholomew .  

The  Antarctic Treaty System Antarctic Treaty  was signed in 1959 by 12 countries. More countries have signed the treaty since then. So far, 46 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty declares that  military  activities and  mineral   mining  are against the law. However, it supports  science scientific  research. It also helps the continent's  ecozone . More than 4,000 scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together. ref name cia cite web url https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#People title Antarctica - The World Factbook publisher United States Central Intelligence Agency date 2007-03-08 accessdate 2007-03-14 ref 

  Geography and geology

Antarctica is covered by an  ice sheet  about four kilometres thick. Under the ice it is mostly land, although the  ice shelf ice shelves  are over the ocean.  The Transantarctic Mountains divide the land between  East Antarctica  in the  Eastern Hemisphere  and West Antarctica in the  Western Hemisphere . 

Antarctica has some important features hidden by the ice. One is  Lake Vostok , which has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years. The lake is 250 km long and 50 km wide. ref name tdg cite web

  Plants  
Few  Embryophyte land plants  grow in Antarctica. This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture (water),  sunlight , good  soil , or a warm temperature. Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer. However,  moss ,  lichen  and  algae  do grow.  The most important organisms in Antarctica are the  plankton  which grow in the ocean. ref name lifepac 

  Animals  
One important source of food in the Antarctic is the  krill , which is a general term for the small shrimp-like  Marine biology marine   crustacea ns. Krill are  near the bottom of the  food chain : they feed on  phytoplankton  and to a lesser extent  zooplankton . Krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet. So  whale s,  penguin s,  Pinniped seals , and even some of the  bird s that live in the Antarctic, depend on krill.

Whales are the largest animals in the ocean, and in Antarctica. They are  mammal s, not  fish . That means that they breathe  air  and do not lay  egg (biology) eggs . Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica. 
 Whaler s have hunted whales for hundreds of years, for  meat  and  blubber .  Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area. 

 Penguin s only live south of the equator. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40 kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30 cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have  black  backs and wings with  white  fronts.  Their  feather s are very tightly packed and make a thick cover.  They also have a layer of woolly  down  under the feathers.  The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them  wikt:waterproof waterproof . ref name lifepac    A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm.  Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean.  They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks.  They nest together in a huge group.

  History of its discovery

For a long time, people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth. They thought this  Terra Australis  would "balance" the lands in the north like  Europe ,  Asia  and  North Africa . People have believed this from the times of  Ptolemy  (1st century AD). He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the  myth ical "Antarctica". However,  geography geographers  still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was.

European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain  James Cook 's ships, HMS  Resolution  and  Adventure , crossed the  Antarctic Circle  on 17 January 1773, in December 1773. ref name mariner  They crossed it again in January 1774. ref name mariner cite web   author The Mariners' Museum   title Age of Exploration: John Cook   url http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php    accessdate 12 February 2006 ref  In fact, Cook did come within about  convert 75 mi km  of the Antarctic  wikt:coast coast .

The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the  Russian Imperial Navy ), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the  Royal Navy ), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington,  Connecticut ). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer  John Davis (sealer) John Davis . He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some  history historians  are not sure about this claim.

People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer. ref name lifepac  At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea. ref name lifepac  However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica. Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land.

The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the  Nimrod Expedition  led by  Ernest Shackleton  in 1907-09. They were the first to climb  Mount Erebus  and to reach the  South Magnetic Pole . Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 - February 1909. They were the first humans to cross the  Ross Ice Shelf , and the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the  Beardmore Glacier ). They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. 

 Robert Falcon Scott , the most well known of all of the explorers, ref name lifepac  wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole. At the same time, another team from  Norway  lead by  Roald Amundsen  started. They both raced each other to the South Pole, but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs. Scott had used ponies and motor sleds, but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen, showing that he had beaten Scott.

On his way back, Scott and three companions met a  wikt:blizzard blizzard  and froze to death while waiting for it to finish. The people who found him eight months later also found his records and  diary , which he had written to the day he died.

 Climate change  and  global warming  are showing effects in Antarctica, particularly the  Antarctic Peninsula .

  People  
People of the Antarctic live in there for a short time to learn more about Antarctica, so most of the people who live there are scientists. Most are in national science stations on the coast. Some bases are far from the sea, for example at the  South pole . They study the  weather , animals,  glacier s, and the  earth's atmosphere . ref name lifepac  Some scientists  wikt:drill drill   ice core s to find out about the weather long ago. People who work in the Antarctic must be careful, because a blizzard can start any time and any where. When they go far away from their shelter, they must always take lots of food just in case.

Today people explore Antarctica using  snowmobile s, which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads. Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit, as a trip. There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica, so people pay to go there in a ship. Some people may just take their own boats. ref name lifepac
