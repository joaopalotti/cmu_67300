 Wine  is an  alcohol ic  drink . The word  wine  is usually used to talk about drinks made from the  juice  of  grape s, although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other  fruit s (such as  plums  or  blackberries ) "wine". This article only deals with wine made from grapes.

Wine is made by the  fermentation  of the sugar in grapes. There are two main types of wine,  red wine  and  white wine .  Red wine is made from red grapes, and white wine is made from white grapes. Rose wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for a very short time. The colour comes only from the skin, so if you have short skin contact, the wine will not turn red but only "pink" ( rose wine ).  Wine sometimes has bubbles in it; this wine is called  sparkling wine . The most popular sparkling wine is  Champagne (wine) champagne , which comes from  France .

People have been making wine for about 5000 years.
