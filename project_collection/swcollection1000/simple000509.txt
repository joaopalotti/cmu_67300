Value

Value  is how much something is  wikt:worth worth . Often the best way to find the value of something is to use the  price  that it can be  wikt:sell sold  for. However  Oscar Wilde  wrote that 'people know the price of everything but the value of nothing'- in other words true value does not depend on money alone.

In  math , a value is a number which is concrete, something everyone can agree upon.  However people may disagree on the value of water, depending if you live in a desert or next to a river.  Disagreements on the value of things can create fights between nations, political parties, religions, etc.
