Negentropy

Negentropy  is reverse  entropy . It means things becoming more in order. By 'order' is meant organisation,  structure  and  function : the opposite of  randomness  or  chaos . One example of negentropy is a star system such as the  Solar System . Another example is  life .

As a general rule, everything in the  universe  tends towards  entropy .  Star system s eventually become dead. All energy has gone, and everything in the system is  at the temperature of the surrounding space . The opposite of entropy is negentropy. It is a  temporary  condition in which certain things are hotter and more highly organised than the surrounding space. This is the  second law of thermodynamics :
 The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated  system  always increases over time. ref It remains constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the  asymmetry  between future and past. ref 

 Life  is considered to be  negentropic  because it takes things in which have less order, like dead  food , and turns it into things with more order, like  cell s in the  body ,  tissue (biological) tissues , and  Organ (anatomy) organs . In doing so, it gives off  heat .  Another example of negentropic things are  Society societies , or social  Systems theory systems , because they take disorderly things such as  Communication communications , and make them into order which is useful to people.
