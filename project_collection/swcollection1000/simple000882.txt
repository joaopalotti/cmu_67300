  History  

England was named after a  Denmark Germanic  tribe called the " Angles ", who settled in Central, Northern, and Eastern England in the 5th century. A related tribe called the " Saxons " settled in the south of England. That is why that period of English history is called "Anglo-Saxon". For the majority of this time, England did not exist as a united country. The  Anglo-Saxons  lived in many small kingdoms, which slowly united. The later countries of England and Wales were formed from the earlier  Roman Britain .

England became one country in  937 . The first King of England was  Athelstan , but he lost a lot of land to  Danelaw Danish invaders , who formed their own country in the East and North. Many villages and towns in this area (particularly in  Yorkshire  and  Lincolnshire ), still have Danish names, and use some Danish-based words. At one time  Wessex  (in the West of England) was the only English kingdom left. After many battles, King  Alfred the Great  of Wessex became king of the whole of England, and the old kingdoms (Mercia,  Northumberland , etc.) just became  province s, called "Earldoms" governed by an " Earl ". Soon after Alfred died, the king of Denmark (Knut or  Canute ) ruled England.

England soon had an English king again. When King  Edward the Confessor  died, Harold (the Earl of Wessex) became king.  William the Conqueror , Duke of  Normandy  (today part of northern France), said that  Harold Godwinson  had promised to make William the king, so he invaded England and fought King Harold at the  Battle of Hastings  in 1066.

William won, and then became king of England. The kings of England spoke French for the next 300 years (The present ruler,  Queen Elizabeth II  is a descendant of William, but not very directly). England took over the country of  Wales  in the 13th century. There were many wars, often against  France  and  Scotland .

For many centuries the religion of England was  Roman Catholicism . The  bishop s (church leaders) of England and all their churches obeyed the  pope  and the church in  Rome ,  Italy . During the  Protestant Reformation  many of the bishops did not agree with this. In the 1530s, the Pope told King  Henry VIII  that he could not divorce his wife. King Henry VIII created the  Church of England  (a " Protestant " church) so that he could divorce his wife, and made it the  State religion official church  in England. For the next 200 years, there was fighting over whether the King (or Queen) of England should be "Roman Catholic" or "Protestant".

Queen  Elizabeth I  was Henry's second daughter. She was a powerful queen who ruled for more than 40 years. When Queen Elizabeth I died, she had no children, and in 1603  James VI of Scotland  (the son of  Mary, Queen of Scots ) became King  James I of England . He called his two countries "Great Britain", but they were still separate countries with their own  parliament s and laws, even though they were in  personal union .

James' son,  Charles I of England Charles I  and the English Parliament fought each other in the  English Civil War  ( Scotland  and  Ireland  were involved as well, but the story is complicated!). Oliver Cromwell became leader of the Parliamentary Army (the "Roundheads") and defeated the Royalist Army (the "Cavaliers"). King Charles was beheaded in 1649 and  Oliver Cromwell  became  dictator  ("Lord Protector"). When Cromwell died, his son Richard was not strong enough to rule, and King  Charles II , the son of Charles I, was invited to come to England and be king in 1660.

When King Charles II died, his brother James II was the next king. A lot of people did not like James because he was  Roman Catholicism Roman Catholic . England was invaded by  William III of England William of Orange  (ruler of part of the Netherlands and husband of Mary, the daughter of King James). Many people welcomed William because he was a  Protestant . James left the country without a fight and Parliament asked William and Mary to become King and Queen together. When  Mary II of England  died, William ruled alone. Queen Mary's  Anne of Great Britain sister Anne  became the next queen. While she was queen, England and Scotland were officially joined as one country. This was called the  Acts of Union 1707 . It also merged their separate parliaments. The parliament in London now included Scottish  Member of Parliament Members of Parliament  ("MPs"), and was called the  Parliament of Great Britain .

After this, the history of England becomes the history of  Great Britain  and  United Kingdom .

The United Kingdom was formed in 1800, when the  Irish Parliament  merged with the British one. Later Ireland fought against this merging and the  Republic of Ireland , which is not quite the whole island called Ireland, became a separate country. The rest of the island,  Northern Ireland , is now the only part of Ireland still in the UK. England is the only country of UK not to have its own government, Parliament or Assembly, but to be Governed by  Parliament of the United Kingdom  which it has a majority of seats in.
