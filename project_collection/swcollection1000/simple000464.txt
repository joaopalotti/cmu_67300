In modern  politics , a  state  is an  association  which has control over a  geography geographic   area  or  territory . States are seen as having three main pieces:
 A  territory 
 A  people 
 Some  institution s (which have the power to make rules).

There are different forms of  government  a state can have, for example a  republic  or a  monarchy . Sometimes states form their own countries. At other times many states work together to form a country (like the  United States ). Most states also have  armed forces ,  civil service ,  law  and  police .

  History  
  Early states  
The earliest states were just  human settlement s. A group of  farmer s and  merchant s working together could be 'states' since people can control them and protect them.

More organized states could be  monarchy monarchies  such as early  Egypt  under the  Pharaoh . Following this were larger more  military -based states such as the  Babylon ian Empire or  Roman Empire . The most famous early states, however, were the  Ancient Greek  states which had freedom, writing and a democracy.

  From military to modern state  
When the military-based state, the Roman Empire, fell, lots of little states were made and each was also military-based and controlled by a  king . These states did not often work together and war raged. However, once people within the state itself started fighting (what's called a  Civil war ), the kings had to make  peace  and start  parliaments .

  Modern states

Modern states soon started in the late 15th century. The main states in Europe were:
 Kingdom of England England  under the  Tudor dynasty Tudors 
 Spain  under the  House of Habsburg Habsburg 
 France  under the  House of Bourbon Bourbons 
 Russia  under  Catherine the Great  and Alexander the Second

These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today. They formed proper  frontier boundaries  for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more, such as the  Church  or the  nobility . They made  army armies ,  tax  systems and  embassy embassies  all to help make them more powerful and  stability stable .

  Different types of state  
Types of state can be separated into two  category categories :  democracy  and  dictatorship . However, just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules.  Iran ,  Pakistan ,  France ,  Germany  and the  United States United States of America  are all states. Each of them sees itself as a  democracy . Each of them however has a different idea of what  democracy  really means.

Different states of the same 'category' can also function differently. For example, two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well-trained  police  or  army  while the other does not. Therefore, the word 'state' only tells us what type of government that state follows (democratic or dictatorship) and does not tell us about the country itself. ref name Bobbio Bobbio, Norberto. 1989.  http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0816618135&id=4AE8ur83g8AC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=8883y8Du41&dq=Bobbio+Democracy+and+Dictatorship&sig=kfL3Vpo83GuEdGmhXJMmTIbBNnw Democracy and Dictatorship: The Nature and Limits of State Power .

  Sub-categories of state  
There are lots of sub-types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship. The main ones are  Pluralism ,  Marxism  and  Institutionalism .

  Pluralism  
Pluralism has been very popular in the United States. It shows the state as a  neutral  place for settling  arguments  between other states. Pluralism tells us that all people are not  Social equality equal , but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do. This type of state is called a  polyarchy . ref Robert Dahl. 1973.  http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0135969816&id=9XY5gFcp6n0C&q=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&dq=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&pgis=1 Modern Political Analysis . Prentice Hall.  http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0135969816&id=9XY5gFcp6n0C&q=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&dq=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&pgis=1 ISBN 0135969816 ref 

Also in a pluralist state, politics, the military and the economy are all united and work together. This means that all power in the state is ' diffusion diffused ' across the people who live there.

  Marxism  
Marxism was popular in  Europe  in the  1960s  and  1970s . It was started by  Karl Marx  and  Friedrich Engels . Marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it, and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments.

The main job of a Marxist state is to protect  capitalist -made profits and to help people make  contract s to keep economy in the state fair. This is a good idea, however, the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who do not make as much money as him. This means that the  working class  (the people who work in  factory factories  etc.) have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power. ref Sweezy, Paul. 1942. The Theory of Capitalist Development. New York: Monthly Review, ch. 13. ref  Basically, instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do, only a small part of the people have power.

  Institutionalism  
Both Marxism and Pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself. Institutionalist states do not see themselves as 'instruments' to be  control led, they are more just geographical areas. In this area, the people just form groups themselves. An Institutionalist state can be made up of both Marxist and Pluralist people, both which have the power to control themselves and not  influence  the other parties of the state. ref Rueschemeyer, Dietrich, Theda Skocpol, and Peter B. Evans, eds. 1985.  http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521313139&id=sYgTwHQbNAAC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=Jyo8optLgc&dq=Skocpol+Rueschemeyer+Bringing+the+State+Back+In&sig=1m3dvluBo9jULIAoYBzEdhVnIeU Bringing the State Back In .

  Anarchism  
 Anarchism  is when a group of people have complete  freedom  and do not believe in having a state at all. Anarchists are a lot like Marxists, since they do not believe that all people are equal, but they believe (opposite to Marxists) that a country can work without any organizations in it. Law and order are not necessary.

Anarchists (such as  Bakunin  and  Kropotkin  in the  19th century ), often want a form of Marxism but ignoring some of their rules. They want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do, rather than getting paid in  wages .
