 Speed  is the  distance  that an  wikt:object object   movement moves  in a given amount of  time . Speed is a  measure  of how fast something is moving. The  average speed  of an object in a certain time is the distance the object traveled  Division (mathematics) divided  by the time.  

 Finding speed 
To find speed  math s math ,

 math s = math math  d \over t math 

where  math d math  is the distance and  math t math  is the time that has gone by.

 Units of measurement for speed 
There are many  units of measurement  for speed. For example, an object's speed can be measured in 
 miles  per  hour  (mph),
 kilometre kilometers  per hour (km/h)
 metre meter s per  second  (m/s), which is the  SI SI-unit  for speed.

 Changing speed 
When an object changes speed, it gets faster or  slow er. If the speed of the object increases, it is called  acceleration . If the object gets slower, and the speed  wikt:decrease decreases , it is called  deceleration , or  negative  acceleration.
