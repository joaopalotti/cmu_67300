# CMU Course 67-300: Search Engines (Mini 4 - Fall Semester 2017)

This repository contains the collection used in the project as well as the many ipython notebooks and course slides.

# Course Overview

This course covers the fundamental aspects of modern search engines. The main intent is to provide a glimpse on how Google, Bing and many   other websites with a search box work. 
Students have the unique chance to implement their own small search engine, and maybe beat Google in the Arab World, as Yandex does in      Russia and Saznam does in the Czech Republic

## Goals

1. Getting to know step-by-step how a modern search engine works. 
2. Be familiarized with basic and advanced concepts of Information Retrieval Theory: information theory, ranking models, evaluation. 
3. This is an unique opportunity to build your own small search engine in Python.
